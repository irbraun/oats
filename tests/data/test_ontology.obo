ontology: to



! This ontology is set up to contain two branches below the root.
!
!
!                                                 --> 2       --> 5
! The first branch of the ontology goes like:   1       --> 4 
!                                                 --> 3       --> 6
!
!
! The second branch of the ontology goes like:  1 --> 7 --> 8 --> 9 
!
!
! This is done to model different aspects of a DAG, such as one term having
! two different parents but those parents then being subclasses of a single
! common term. The second branch just includes a linear set of terms that
! subclasses of one another going back up to the root term. This ontology
! is very small so that properties like subclasses, superclases, Jaccard
! similarity, and information can be calculated by hand and checked inside
! of tests.
