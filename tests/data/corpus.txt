The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . `` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . Wards protected The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . ( 2 ) Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . His petition charged mental cruelty . The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin . Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . The petition listed the mayor's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. . The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. Aj . Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney . Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1 . He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday . Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign . Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Construction bonds Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work . A revolving fund The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin . The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . Colquitt -- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' . The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402 . Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . `` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said . `` Being at the polls was just like being at church . I didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' . The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . `` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` There wasn't a bit of trouble '' . Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Austin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . One validated acts of school districts . Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed . One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . Austin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . Austin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . `` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts '' . Austin , Texas -- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . `` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover . College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . Paris , Texas ( sp. ) -- The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president . Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma . He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A & I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla. . In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology . During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College . He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army . Denton , Texas ( sp. ) -- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . `` Must solve problem '' The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . `` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ? `` Yes , your honor '' , replied Bellows . `` What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . There is a conflict among the defendants '' . Washington , July 24 -- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio . The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone . Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion . Decisions are made Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' . Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city . The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' . Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases . In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' . Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutor . Issue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury . Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation . Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning . Karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' . He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the Criminal court processes . `` Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court . Faced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons . Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another . The cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward . The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns . Two other cases also were under advisement . Claims precedent lacking After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them . Washington , Feb. 9 -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill . It was defeated in Congress last year . Cost up to $37 a year It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . Outlays would increase Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . Both figures would go higher in later years . Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . Nursing home care The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 2 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 3 Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . 4 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . Calls proposal modest He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . `` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . `` This is not a program of socialized medicine . It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . Wouldn't pay doctors The plan does not cover doctor bills . They would still be paid by the patient . Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . Contributions to schools The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . More for nursing homes In the area of `` community health services '' , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . Asks research funds The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . He did not say by how much . For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . Reaction as expected Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan . Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the House . Washington , Feb. 9 -- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . Enforce by demand The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 . Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . Exploratory mood A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited . The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters . The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . Conflict surveyed The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . This increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . Washington The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos . The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this . The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated . But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . Policies modified The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference . This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union . He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . GOP restrained It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it . They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba . One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score . His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination . Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators . Detente urged This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' . It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation . But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated . Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors . Aid plans revamped Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . But thus far there has been no response in kind . Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture . Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos . But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate . And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos . But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos . ( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however . ) There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam . The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos . The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army . There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt . If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna . Washington The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States . The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . Offenses multiply The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . East Providence now has no civil defense program . Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . He is not interested in being named a full-time director . Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . Mr. Hawksley said . One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station . He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area . Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point . Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly . The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls . A copy was released to the press . Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant . The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said . `` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , Mr. Notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' . The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws . The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath . The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday . The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday '' , the council's resolution said . The small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday . They `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' . That , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . `` That was before I studied law . Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. . The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post . Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . `` After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . `` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' . He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . `` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September . Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system . Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting . Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance . At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition . Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . `` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? He asked . The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . `` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark . Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' . Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . `` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , Mitchell said . Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . `` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , Jones said . The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . Defends Ike Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : `` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . `` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . `` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' . Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . `` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . That failed . `` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . That , too , will fail '' . Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 . Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner . Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals . `` My experience as public safety commissioner '' , Roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . Jim Sheeran fits that description '' . Trenton -- William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service . A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section . Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education . Boonton -- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' . He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : `` When I come back here after the November election you'll think , ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' . He said , `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time '' . Attacks Republicans In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . But we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . `` We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November '' . He said , `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' . He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy '' . He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . `` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean '' , the former Superior Court judge said . `` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s '' . Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people '' , Hughes asked , `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November '' . Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's `` Green Acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday . Conservation plan The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state . The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . Hughes said , `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it '' , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve '' . Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved . He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans . `` After the primary '' , he promised , `` I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee '' . Trenton -- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters . A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment . She served one four-year term on the national committee . Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . Opposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader . Mayor visits Buckley As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader . He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor . Screvane and Beame hailed The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller . The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx . After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York Times . The Mayor said : `` It didn't come from me . But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates '' . Boston , June 16 -- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . `` It's ' See Joe , see Jim ' '' , he says . `` The hand is out '' . A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , `` The Last Hurrah '' . But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations . And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . Day after day some new episode is reported . The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . Washington , June 18 -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee . It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor . Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday . Leadership is hopeful The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy . They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts . Three groups to meet What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 . This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee . About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview . Six of these were proposed by religious groups . They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . Question raised Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . When he protested , the hotel owner said : `` Why do you worry ? ? The U. S. Government is paying for it . The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' . Missionary explains `` I don't work for the Government '' , the American said . `` I'm a missionary '' . The hotel owner shrugged . `` Same thing '' , he said . And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . Moscow , June 18 -- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : `` Look , he took everything I had '' ! ! Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker . Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid . The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates . This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 . In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries . United Nations , N. Y. , June 18 -- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations . This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations . One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India . India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations . Formula is due this week The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week . The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start . Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point . Geneva , June 18 -- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces . The latter two are half-brothers . Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos . An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded . But no one was overly optimistic . Tactics studied in Geneva W. Averell Harriman of the United States , Malcolm MacDonald of Britain , Maurice Couve De Murville , France's Foreign Minister , and Howard C. Green , Canada's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week . Princess Moune , Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter , read the Princes' statement . They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she said . The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days . To deal with principles The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government . Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill. . Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . They reside at 4911 Miles Dr. . Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . Many buildings Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . Seats on square Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House . In this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans . Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units . About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . Division one of the parade will be the service academies . Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson . Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union . Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states . Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa , the trust territories and the Canal Zone . Jackson , Miss. -- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ? Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett . Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year . Could be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session . The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . Districts issue Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature . Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House . Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . Future clouded Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election . Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . Baton Rouge , La. -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . Legislators weary Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes . Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy . If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature . Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . Underlying concern Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition . He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . Constant problem In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature . This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract . The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . Concern bankrupt The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d St. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law . On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr. . Intervenes in case The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms . Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co. . At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . `` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , Berger said . The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track . The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints . The city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged . Wide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint . The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per joint . But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint . Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference . Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company . `` We won't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , Wagner said . `` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , Berger said . Wagner replied , `` Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172,000 ' '' ? ? ' know enough to sue ' Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El . `` We want to find out who knew about it '' , Pratt said . `` Certain people must have known about it '' . `` The PTC is investigating the whole matter '' , Pratt said . Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year . Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee . For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said . Testifies at hearing His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services . The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that . The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room . The cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 . Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels . Revenue estimated The city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year . The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses . A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs . The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog . Commissioner replies Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care . In reply , Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees . He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites . Backs higher fees City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year . The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said . The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis . Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday , it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car . The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower , Davenport said . Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time . He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning . Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery , 39 . His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation . The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project . The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project . One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 . The tract is bounded by Island Ave. , Dicks Ave. , 61st St. , and Eastwick Ave. . Four parks planned It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores . The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project . The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project . Would bar vehicles The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp. . The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic . It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project . The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development . The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project . Kansas City , Mo. , Feb. 9 ( UPI ) -- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work . Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles . He was in Baptist Memorial hospital . Ignition sets off blast The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work . `` I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway '' , he said . Gladden's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house . The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall . Hood flies over house The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house . The left front wheel landed 100 feet away . Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel . It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter . Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night . The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union . Led fight on teamsters Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 . The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing . A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City , Kas. . The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett . Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee . Both have been active in the association . Ankara , Turkey , Oct. 24 ( AP ) -- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president . An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat . By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government . The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president . Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months . The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned . Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own . Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . He is married and the father of three children . Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E. M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . `` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up '' . Martin called for patience on the part of Americans . `` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build '' , he said . By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . Individual help best `` We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient '' , the assistant secretary said . Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost '' . Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack . But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful '' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . `` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster '' , he said . `` Nobody really expects to evacuate . I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand '' , said , `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' . Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' . Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program . The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done . Salem ( AP ) -- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov. Mark Hatfield . Hatfield also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception in the state capitol on Tuesday . His schedule calls for a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club .

Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session . A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January . Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system . Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools . Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen. Wayne L. Morse , Aj .

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum . The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible . At the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' . New point added Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : `` The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' . The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- His miracles -- His substitutionary work on the cross -- His bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of God . Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God . His offices are in Springfield , Mo. . Election came on the nominating ballot . Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , `` Breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with `` Breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years . The Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work . `` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life '' , he told delegates Friday . Church loses pace Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' . `` In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches '' , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . `` In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none '' , he said . To step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years . To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . ' church meets change ' `` The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' . A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches . -- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . -- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . -- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial . Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' . Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : `` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out '' . In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . Robinson doubles again In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . Carey Singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row . 15 pounds lighter The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . Seeks `` improved fielding '' The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees . Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest . Duren , Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . Squad cut near Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky. . The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; ; J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast . `` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo , too '' , added Old Scrapiron . `` Then we'd really have someplace to go '' . Bowie , Md. , March 17 -- Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. , Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 8,280 attend races Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Culmone gets first win Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . Cleveland , March 17 ( AP ) -- George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield . Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . San Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here . Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . St. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) -- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today . Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . `` This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . `` So I started practicing on it in spring training . Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . `` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . `` Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . Practice helps you to get your timing down . `` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session . `` If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . Footnotes : In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma . Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . It didn't ; ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University . The Mustangs don't play this week . `` We're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy . `` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' . Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . We needed it and we got it '' . Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon . Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . `` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . `` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory . `` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . `` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . `` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . `` He almost brought it back all the way '' . Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . `` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . `` He'll be out of action all this week . He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . `` He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run '' , Meek explained . `` We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play '' . The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . `` We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . We'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off '' . SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21 . Huddle hearsay -- Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A & M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud . End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions . `` Just our luck '' ! ! Exclaimed Stram . `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . `` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . `` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas , Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A & M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) . A & M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight . They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left . Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout . The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove . Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies . The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . Bingles and bobbles : Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits . It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ . Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage . Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . Dallas , Tex. , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . St. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday . Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans . It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss . The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left . The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard . Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front . A double by Green , Allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth . Ogden , Utah , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . `` I've had it '' , he told a newsman . `` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' . This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited . She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : `` I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances '' . The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes . Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I don't think you want to talk to him . You'll probably get a ball bat on the head . He's mad at the world '' . But Jackie had gone into the station . Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . `` I told him who I was and he was quite cold . But he warmed up after a while . I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . He said he had never talked to Liston '' . Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : `` I can't hit anymore . I can't run . I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . `` Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field . Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road . Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle . This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30-30 . Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy . This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) -- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning . Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter . The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager . Only Bucky Harris , the `` boy-manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . Choice was expected The selection had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . Coach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. . He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year . Show follows ceremonies A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . Flushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . Shea was born in Manhattan . He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . Maris is in line for a big raise . Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280-yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . No margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . So he wound up with a dozen . `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . Stickler for rules `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . `` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . `` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . He had a 16 . Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . Nor were there any rules to save him . If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . This knowledge has come in handy , too . His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . The ball floated downstream . A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . Ruling from on high `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? Asked Palmer of an official . `` No '' , said the official . `` You must play it where it lies '' . `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : `` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season . `` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . `` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . Change in pitchers . Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . After Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium . Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game . Mizell has won both of his starts . Nieman kept in lineup . After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants . `` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said . `` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' . `` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . `` He should be getting back in the groove before long . Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday . Six Bucks over . Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each , Dick Stuart , Don Hoak and Bob Skinner . Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs . Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . `` We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . `` Virdon has been blasting the ball . No plunkers for him '' . Six Bucs over . The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season . On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . In 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 . A year later they were 4-13 . Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer . In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do . `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch . Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory . Benington said , `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . After the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me '' . Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award . Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington . On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 '' . Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich . `` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out . `` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game . Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City . The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday . Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple . St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field . The game opened a busy week for Washington . The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . Happy hitting If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . And that's meant as a boost , not a knock . Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . Their heights , that is . Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie . His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . Labor relations Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . The old man was almost too possessive . Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York . With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far . The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark . Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother , J. Hampton Monroe , and Mrs. Monroe .

' back with the Met `` We are back with the ' Met ' again now that the ' Met ' is back in Chicago '' , bulletins Mrs. Frank S.

Birgit Nilsson will be starred . `` Housed in the new McCormick Place theater , this should prove to be an exciting evening '' , adds Mrs. Sims . The board's last money raising event was a performance by Harry Belafonte -- `` quite off-beat for this group '' , decided some of the members . Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of Winnetka , a new board member , will be chairman of publicity for the benefit . Her husband recently was appointed vice president of the university , bringing them back here from the east . Parichy-Hamm Because of the recent death of the bride's father , Frederick B. Hamm , the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St. Bernadine's church , Forest Park . A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel . Mrs. Hamm will not come from Vero Beach , Fla. , for the wedding . However , Mr. Parichy and his bride will go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip , and will stay in the John G. Beadles' beach house . The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest . Harvey B. Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in marriage . Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and the bride's other uncles and aunts , the Rush C. Butlers , the Homer E. Robertsons , and the David Q. Porters , will give the bridal dinner tonight in the Stevenses' home .

Later , a bus will carry members to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional tennis matches at 8 p.m. . With loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St. Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears , its director , Helen Tieken Geraghty ( Mrs. Maurice P. Geraghty ) is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International Trade fair . Armed with letters from embassies to ministers of countries , especially those in the near and far east , Mrs. Geraghty `` will beat the bushes for oriental talent '' . `` We ( the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry ) expect to establish closer relations with nations and their cultural activities , and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts '' , explains Mrs. Geraghty . `` For instance , Djakarta , Indonesia , has three groups of dancers interested in coming here . I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus '' ! ! The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa . First , Honolulu Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop . Then Japan , Hong Kong , Manila , India , Pakistan , Damascus , Beirut , and to Rome , London , and Paris `` to look over wonderful talent '' . Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return ; ; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter , Molly , bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night . Molly already has her cotillion gown , and it's fitted , says her mother . Also , invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts club . It won't be a `` tea '' , however , but more of an international folk song festival , with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world . The international theme will be continued with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will give in the Racquet club after the tea . Miss Abra Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day . Burke-Rostagno The Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter , Helen Lambert , and the young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith college . He is Aldo Rostagno , son of the Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in Europe . The Burkes , who now live in Kankakee , are telling friends of the engagement . Miss Burke , a graduate of Miss Hall's school , stayed on in Florence as a career girl . Her fiance , who is with a publishing firm , translates many books from English into Italian . He will be coming here on business in December , when the wedding is to take place in Wayne . Miss Burke will arrive in December also . Here and there A farewell supper Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Sethness Jr. planned Sunday for Italian Consul General and Mrs. Giacomo Profili has been canceled because Mr. Sethness is in Illinois Masonic hospital for surgery .

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. . The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a `` civilian '' with the Army . Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . The job also covers a number of other items . `` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . `` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . `` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . `` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` No Vacancy '' . No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . And where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? Ah , that is simple . Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . That is where we turn in the good old summertime . The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . Many with pools Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . All for $14 ! ! At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . All for $14 . That made up for the `` best '' motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church . Parents of the bride are Mr. and Mrs. Ferris M. Gay , 7034 Coronado . The bridegroom is the son of Mrs. James Baines of Los Angeles , Calif. , and Carl E. Howard of Santa Monica , Calif. .

Her husband , who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport , La. , and the late Mrs. Henry Cater Parmer , was president of Alpha Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at Lamar Tech , and did graduate work at Rhodes University in Grahamstown , South Africa , on a Rotary Fellowship . The Rev. Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs. Marvin Hand presented music . The bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed with bateau neckline and princesse skirt accented by lace appliques . Her veil was caught to a crown , and she carried gardenias and stephanotis . Miss Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor , and bridesmaids were Miss Pat Dawson of Austin , Mrs. Howard M. Dean of Hinsdale , Ill. , and Mrs. James A. Reeder of Shreveport , La. . Cecil Mason of Hartford , Conn. , was best man for his brother , and groomsmen were Rhodes S. Baker 3 , of Houston , Dr. James Carter of Houston and Conrad McEachern of New Orleans , La. . Lee Jackson and Ken Smith , both of Houston , and Alfred Neumann of Beaumont seated guests . After a reception at The Mayfair , the newlyweds left for a wedding trip to New Orleans , La. . They will live in Corpus Christi . Miss Shirley Joan Meredith , a former student of North Texas State University , was married Saturday to Larry W. Mills , who has attended Arlington State College . They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh after a wedding trip to Corpus Christi . Parents of the couple are Ray Meredith of Denton and the late Mrs. Meredith and Mrs. Hardy P. Mills of Floresville and the late Mr. Mills . The Rev. Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony in Slaughter Chapel of the First Baptist Church . Dan Beam presented music and the bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse lines and featuring a flared skirt and lace jacket with bateau neckline . Her veil was caught to a pearl headdress , and she carried stephanotis and orchids . Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's maid of honor , and Vernon Lewelleyn of San Angelo was best man . Robert Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr. seated guests . A reception was held at the church . The First Christian Church of Pampa was the setting for the wedding last Sunday of Miss Marcile Marie Glison and Thomas Earl Loving Jr. , who will live at 8861 Gaston after a wedding trip to New Orleans , La. The bride , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ervin Glison of Pampa , has attended Texas Woman's University and will continue her studies at Aj . `` A Night in New Orleans '' is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . Mrs. H. J. Grinsfelder is chairman . The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality `` and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night '' , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , `` that is exactly what we expect to offer them . We've been working for weeks . The prospects look great . We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . But we can't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' . Basin Street Beat But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will `` give with the Basin Street beat '' during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the dancing . As for food , Mrs. Henry Louchheim , chairman of this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food . `` New Orleans '' ? ? She says , `` of course I've had the best . It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no R's , so no oysters . But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties . I know they will be good . We've tried them out on the club chef -- or say , he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best '' . Scenic effects Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic effects . There will be masses of flowers , reproductions of the handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are typical of New Orleans . Mrs. Harry K. Cohen is chairman of this phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A. Van Hollander , display director of Gimbel Brothers . The gala is the Thrift Shop's annual bundle party and , as all Thrift Shop friends know , that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition , contributions of household equipment , bric-a-brac and such to stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St. . Bundle centers For the convenience of guests bundle centers have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations may be deposited between now and the date of the big event . In addition to the bundles , guests pay the cost of their dinners . Members of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing time are welcomed . The Thrift Shop , with Mrs. Bernhard S. Blumenthal as president , is one of the city's most successful fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies . Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000 . It's big business `` Big business , this little Thrift Shop business '' , say the members . For most of the 25 years the operation was under feminine direction . In the past few years the men , mostly husbands of members , have taken an interest . Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's committee that , among other jobs , takes over part of the responsibility for staffing the shop during its evening hours . Mrs. Theodore Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee for the gala . Mrs. Richard Newburger is chairman of hostesses .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street . In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken Street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home . The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis . His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body . Boy in fair condition The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . His condition was reported to be fair . Police said the children's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . Cites discrepancies Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . `` I hate to have these things come up again and again '' , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . `` These are the board's minutes . I'll write what you tell me to '' . For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so . State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street . He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance . Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . His condition was said to be , `` fair '' . Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street . Barber summoned He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month . Werner criticized Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December . Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , Mr. Schaefer said . The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations '' on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm . Sent home for rest Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest . Work resumed Wednesday , he said . Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced '' . Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' . Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes . Annapolis , Jan. 7 ( special ) -- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention . The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 . Each had been shot in the back several times with a automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives . Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail . The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court . Younger son calls police Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car . The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio . Two brothers adopted Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs . Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis . The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland's Secretary of State . Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named Attorney General to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals . Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday . Simpkins from Somerset Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child . Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947 . Five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law . Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 . From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates . Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported . Dodge reported the following breakdown : Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house . Convenience held key `` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 '' , Pantas predicted . Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section . Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation . London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . Flashed to Moscow A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . ( In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City ) . In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . All five pleaded innocent . Only Miss Gee asked for bail . Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . Refuses to grant bail `` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . He promptly went to communist East Germany . The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . `` This is Russian money '' , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office . He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . `` Of highest value '' The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . Court cleared Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it . Navy's future involved `` Much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . `` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . Interested in detector The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . Range was a vital detail . Designs of parts were sought . Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . ' had to know peddlers ' `` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , Sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . This , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . `` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' . No comments by U.S. In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana Av. . Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan Av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted . Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart Av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way . Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee . His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck . Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School , 30th Street and South Park Way , and began `` skylarking '' . When 51st Street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor . As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down . Then the youths fled with his money . Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier . She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office . Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 . It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place . The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 . The defendant , William L. Stickney 3 , 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month . Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay Rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president . Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street . At Jenks Street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks . The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie . St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . -- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . Still , I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' . Lives on welfare Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police . He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach . However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial . Charges in doubt Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl . Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . Locked in motel A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . The jury foreman , Mrs. Olive Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence . She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid . The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . The verdict came three hours later . Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . A Sterling Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy . Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs. Mary Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren . Services tomorrow Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne's Catholic Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren . The mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home , 31730 Mound , Warren . Mrs. Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East . Held candle Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . Christine's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; ; Dennis , 6 ; ; Eleanor , 2 ; ; and Bernardine , 1 . `` All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted '' , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon . Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills . A135 donated Neighbor women , such as Mrs. Sidney Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister-in-law , Mrs. Anna Kowalski , 22111 David , East Detroit . Another neighbor , Mrs. Frank C. Smith , 2731 Pall Mall , Sterling Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs . John C. Houghton , president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family . Students help out Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East . He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 , Warren Village Station . Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east . Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski . Funds from dances Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night . `` Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said . There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School , 3505o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine . Expresses thanks Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday .

I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them '' . An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . Patrolman George Kimmell , of McClellan Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps School , for his assistance in the case . Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk . Gets car number Kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly `` took off at high speed '' , he said , narrowly missing him . Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . Returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive . Given 15 days He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction . The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June . The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today . Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire . Help asked In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its `` friends and neighbors '' for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom . Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home . He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire . A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said . Plea for arms The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana . He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers . He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body . A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown . Heavy support The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam . The minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos . There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated . Havana , April 19 . -- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair . The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio , where the executions took place . Arms plot charged The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels . Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's regime . Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami . McNair , 25 , was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio , about 35 miles from Havana . Report others held At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup . Among them were a number of newsmen , including Henry Raymont , of United Press International , and Robert Berrellez , of Associated Press . So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails . More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests . Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state , few emerge in the West to tell about it . M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF ) -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945 . Today , M. Kegham was in Detroit , en route to join his wife and children in California . Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . `` Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . `` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church . Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation . Urged in 1954 The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . `` From its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said Friday , `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . `` As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . `` There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . Corporate existence `` On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia . `` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education '' . A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street , NE , police said . The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims , 19 , of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir. , Aj . Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole . The other occupants were James Willard Olvey , 18 , of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave. , NE , and Larry Coleman Barnett , 19 , of 704 Hill St. , SE , both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises . The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins '' if negotiations failed . The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights . ' intend to attend ' `` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year '' , the identically worded letters said . The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations . They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate . Downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the Friday mail . However , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend . Gather here The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday . Several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair . Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago . Charles A. Black , COAHR chairman , said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up . He declined to name the three . Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting . Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' . Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '' A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '' Besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead .

Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest . The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup , Pierce , Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants , according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist . Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical , heptachlor , over 30,000 acres in Troup , 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties . The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties , over 37,679 acres . The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon . Also being treated are Houston , Bleckley , Tift , Turner and Dodge counties , Blasingame said . The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia , attacking crops , young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom , Blasingame said . The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week . This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . `` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ? Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. . `` My feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him . The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' . Harvey criticized Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday . A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff . `` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this . I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' . Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' .

Huntley was arrested in Phoenix , Ariz. , last week and will be returned to Portland to face charges of assault and robbery , Portland detectives said Friday .

Nolan 3rd , the Democratic-endorsed committee chairman , could not be reached for comment . In its ruling , the state Board of Education upheld Dr. Michael F. Walsh , state commissioner of education , who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F. Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual education without first finding that the school superintendent's candidate was not suitable . Supt. Clarence S. Taylor had recommended Roger I. Vermeersch for the post . Milton and Rosella Lovett of Cranston were awarded $55,000 damages from the state in Superior Court yesterday for industrial property which they owned at 83 Atwells Ave. , Providence , and which was condemned for use in construction of Interstate Route 95 . The award was made by Judge Fred B. Perkins who heard their petition without a jury by agreement of the parties . The award , without interest , compared with a valuation of $57,500 placed on the property by the property owners' real estate expert , and a valuation of $52,500 placed on it by the state's expert . The property included a one-story brick manufacturing building on 8,293 square feet of land . Saul Hodosh represented the owners . Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent appeared for the state . Santa's lieutenants in charge of the Journal-Bulletin Santa Claus Fund are looking for the usual generous response this year from Cranston residents . Persons who find it convenient may send their contributions to the Journal-Bulletin's Cranston office at 823 Park Avenue . All contributed will be acknowledged . The fund's statewide quota this year is $8,250 to provide Christmas gifts for needy youngsters . Scores of Cranston children will be remembered . Cranston residents have been generous contributors to the fund over the years . Public school children have adopted the fund as one of their favorite Christmas charities and their pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters aid greatly in helping Santa to reach the fund's goal . Bernard Parrillo , 20 , of 19 Fletcher Ave. , Cranston , was admitted to Roger Williams Hospital shortly before 11:30 a.m. yesterday after a hunting accident in which a shotgun he was carrying discharged against his heel . Mr. Parrillo was given first aid at Johnston Hose 1 . ( Thornton ) where he had been driven by a companion . The two had been hunting in the Simmonsville area of town and Mr. Parrillo dropped the gun which fired as it struck the ground . Hospital officials said the injury was severe but the youth was in good condition last night . A check for $4,177.37 representing the last payment of a $50,000 federal grant to Rhode Island Hospital was presented to the hospital administrator , Oliver G. Pratt , yesterday by Governor Notte . The hospital has used the money to assist in alterations on the fifth floor of the Jane Brown Hospital , part of Rhode Island Hospital . The work added eight beds to the hospital , giving it a total capacity of 646 general beds . Vincent Sorrentino , founder and board chairman of the Uncas Mfg. Co. , has been designated a Cavaliere of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy . The decoration will be presented by A. Trichieri , Italian consul general in Boston , at a ceremony at 30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at the plant , which this year is celebrating its golden anniversary . About 500 employes of the firm will be on hand to witness bestowal of the honor upon Mr. Sorrentino . Mr. Sorrentino will be honored on the evening of Dec. 7 at a dinner to be given by the Aurora Club at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel . The Newport-based destroyer picket escort Kretchmer has arrived back at Newport after three months' patrol in North Atlantic waters marked by mercy jobs afloat and ashore . On Sept. 6 , the Kretchmer rescued the crew of a trawler they found drifting on a life raft after they had abandoned a sinking ship . In August while stopping in Greenock , Scotland , three members of the crew on liberty rendered first aid to a girl who fell from a train . Local authorities credited the men with saving the girl's life . Birmingham , Ala. -- ( AP ) -- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the `` Freedom Rider '' bus burning trial four weeks ago . U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury . He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala. . Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders . The bus was burned outside Anniston . One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal . A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . Neither was seated on the jury . Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . The judge replaced the juror with an alternate . No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents . At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections . One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time . He was not seated on the jury . The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction . New York -- ( UPI ) -- The New York University Board of Trustees has elected the youngest president in the 130-year history of NYU , it was announced yesterday . The new president is 37-year-old Dr. James McN. Hester , currently dean of the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . He will take over his new post Jan. 1 . Dr. Hester , also one of the youngest men ever to head a major American university , succeeds Dr. Carroll V. Newsom who resigned last September to join Prentice-Hall Inc. publishing firm . Dr. Hester , of Princeton , N.J. , is a native of Chester , Pa. He joined NYU in September , 1960 . Prior to that he was associated with Long Island University in Brooklyn . Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . `` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . `` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . `` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society . The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield . Buchheister pledged the land would be an `` inviolate '' sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants . Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . This had never been done before . Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile . He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . `` The first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . `` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . It was time to go up myself '' . Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight . Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . `` She flew beautifully '' , said Fiedler . `` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . `` It's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' . John Di Massimo has been elected president of the 1961 Columbus Day Celebration Committee , it was announced yesterday . Other officers are Angelo J. Scampini , vice president , Joseph V. Arata , treasurer , and Fred J. Casassa , secretary . Judge John B. Molinari was named chairman of the executive committee . Elected to the board of directors were : Elios P. Anderlini , Attilio Beronio , Leo M. Bianco , Frederic Campagnoli , Joseph Cervetto , Armond J. De Martini , Grace Duhagon , John P. Figone , John P. Figone Jr. , Stephen Mana , John Moscone , Calude Perasso , Angelo Petrini , Frank Ratto , and George R. Reilly . Dr. Albert Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale . Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday . In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr. Schweitzer wrote : `` Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . `` They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; otherwise no peace is possible . `` Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency '' . A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service . Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . Glimco a buddy Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti . Another hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview . `` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier '' , Stein said . `` But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll '' . Connection is sought Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex . The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant . Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St. . The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . Lee a witness Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee , director of McCormick Place ; ; Jerome Leavitt , a partner in the Union Liquor company , 3247 S. Kedzie Av. , Dominic Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; and Frank W. Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av. . Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place . Stein's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay . Stein estimated this amount at `` about $1,500 or $1,600 a month '' . A $12,500 payment Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers . Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' union . Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year . All of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt . Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll '' at National Maintenance company . The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av. . The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday . The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . Curtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000 . Lien payments involved Huff's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' . Huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage . Charge lists 3 checks The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the association . The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 . On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av. . There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . Later , Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit card . All bounced . When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police . Bonn , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today . Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share . But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering . `` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas . Cable confirmation '' , it said translated . But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares . After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . But the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . `` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do . But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . First , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . Second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market . Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up . And third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . Foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . The potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito . All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . Now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars . More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman . It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history . The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars . It weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year . A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area . The Murray Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated in Dallas in 1896 . They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's . More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown . Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm . The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899 . The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 . Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala. . Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala. . About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes . The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world . Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment . The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co. . They export also . The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies . In 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment . Presently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year . The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912 . Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga. . The district office here employs about 65 . The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here . The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959 . Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock . The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928 . The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment . The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation . Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people . They export cotton ginning machinery . The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment '' . This includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin . The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the Mississippi Delta . The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here . They make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery . The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas . They've been in Dallas since 1921 . Cotton Belt Gin Service , Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago . They distribute equipment in 11 states . The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting , bearings , etc. . Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy . New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year . Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year . Totaling 3,399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963 . However , compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441 , this March was off 23 per cent . On a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744 . This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier . With the March pickup , dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year . The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter . On the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars . Only three standard models -- Buick , Chrysler , and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county . The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project . Now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship . Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields . More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis . Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T. Owens , national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp. of New York . The 33 honored students are : Mike Trigg , Raymond Arrington , and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams , Janice Whitney , Fil Terral , and Carl David Page of W. H. Adamson ; ; Bill Burke , Tommie Freeman , and Lawrence Paschall of N. R. Crozier Tech. Paulah Thompson , Gerald Kestner , and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest ; ; Arnold Hayes , Mary Ann Shay , and Lloyd Satterfield of Thomas Jefferson ; ; William Cluck , Deloris Carrel Carty , and Edna Earl Eaton of North Dallas ; ; Patricia Ann Neal , Johnny Carruthers , and David McLauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville ; ; David Wolverton , Sharon Flanagan , and James Weaver of W. W. Samuels ; ; William Austin , Gary Hammond , and Ronnie Davis of South Oak Cliff ; ; Bill Eaton , Carolyn Milton , and Ronnie Bert Stone of Sunset ; ; and Charles Potter , Ronnie Moore , and Robert Bailey of Woodrow Wilson . The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration , came under fire in Dallas last week . The Administration's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated Caron S. Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' . He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . ' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . `` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . Danger cited He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike . Sacrifices needed Draper declared , `` As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today . We must justify our heritage . We must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' . He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration , that `` Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' . He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' . While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro , `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere . Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that '' . New York ( AP ) -- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks . Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average . It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages . Some good news Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news . A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month . Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxes . The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87 . Of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined . New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 . Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day . Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday . A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American Marketing Assn. . However , Peterson , president of Bell & Howell , warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' . Creations needed `` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , Peterson said . `` With this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' . The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs . Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas . He cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology . He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market . Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange , effective Tuesday , has been announced by Thomas P. Phelan , president of the exchange . Taylor , president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co. , Beverly Hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925 . Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon , Read & Co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp. . Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to Union . Under the new offering , only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares . Due in 1986 The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures , due June 1 , 1986 , at 100% , and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 , 1991 , at 100% . The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1 , 1966 ; ; $70 by 1971 ; ; $75 by 1976 ; ; $80 by 1981 ; ; $85 by 1986 , and $90 thereafter . New York ( AP ) -- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled . Volume was 1.23 million shares , down from Monday's 1.58 million . Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic Foil . Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained 2-1/2 each . Question -- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8 , 1960 . Something has gone wrong some place . I am getting dividends on only 50 shares . In other words , I am getting only half the dividends I should . Answer -- Write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City , N.J. . That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund . The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things . But it seems that this `` electronic brain '' wasn't `` programmed '' correctly . This resulted in a great number of errors . And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders . I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation . At that time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand . They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days '' . That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts . Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected . Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank . Doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries . He selects queries or general interest to answer . Washington ( AP ) -- Alfred Hayes , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system . Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations , `` there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' . Washington ( UPI ) -- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge . Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect . The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj . `` All these kind of things weaken us '' , Perlman said . Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad . `` The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s '' , he told the hearing . C & O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case . The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B & Aj . Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger . The proposed C & O-B & O railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest . Washington ( AP ) -- The government's short-term borrowing costs rose with Tuesday's weekly offering of Treasury bills . On $1.1 billion of 90-day bills , the average yield was 2.325% . The rate a week ago was 2.295% . Washington , March 11 ( UPI ) . -- `` Consumer uncertain about economic conditions '' . This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center . Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . Increase expected The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference . It disclosed that the builders : Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts . The industry has said 1960 was a poor year . Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 . Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? Leaders of industry The reason , says the Housing Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . Elburn , Ill. -- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . We sold only four pickers all last year '' . Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . `` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . The higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . `` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. . For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . Two of three report gains Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . `` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa . `` This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . Last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; in August of 1960 , he sold seven . Dealers' stocks down With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports . Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president . With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . Net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July . Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling . The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . Such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . `` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the President said . Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S. . The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution . Requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show . In such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law . The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . The Tax Court rejected this view . It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . The Service has not said what its next step will be . Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled . The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances . Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage . She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . State briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area . Colorado has a 2% sales tax . Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax . The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent . The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales . The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities . Washington -- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported . The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion . April sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) . The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March . Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March . Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion . Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It's unlike me '' . In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . A favorite is Norman Norell , however . She likes his classic chemise . Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell , a black and white organdy and silk jersey . Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette . She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose . Balenciaga is her favorite European designer . `` I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress '' , she reminisces . `` I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion '' . Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens . Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent , Greer Garson was born in County Down , Ireland . Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles . Reared in England , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London . She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm . Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End . Among stage performances was a starring role in `` Golden Arrow '' directed by Noel Coward . It was during `` Old Music '' at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B. Mayer spotted her . After signing a motion-picture contract , she came to America and had `` Goodbye , Mr. Chips '' as her first assignment after a year's wait . Other triumphs include `` Random Harvest '' , `` Madame Curie '' , `` Pride and Prejudice '' , `` The Forsythe Saga '' and `` Mrs. Miniver '' ( which won her the Academy Award in 1943 ) . Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless . Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in `` Sunrise at Campobello '' . She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` Captain Brassbound's Conversion '' to `` Camille '' . She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London , a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states . She is adept at skeet shooting , trout fishing , Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology . She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts . She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations . Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico . Back in college , today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food . The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy . Last October he gave a public speech in Washington , D.C. entitled `` Are Women Here To Stay '' ? ? So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey , director of SMU's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef . He is apt to rear back and claim his rights . Ramsey , as SMU's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week . Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! ! He also dishes up 3,000 snacks . And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center , along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables . Ramsey , 6-3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says , `` I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook '' . He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to Aj . And you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line . What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ? `` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat '' , says Ramsey . So he hides the mayonnaise . And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments . What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ? `` Pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza '' , says the handsome food expert . `` Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' . Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman , Henry Cabot Lodge , the King of Morocco , Clement Atlee and other shiny characters . Once four Tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line . `` They aren't supposed to look at women , you know '' , Ramsey recalled . `` What with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard time '' . Chicken Cadillac Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest . Salt and pepper each breast . Dip in melted butter and roll in flour . Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan . Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown . Add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts . Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer . While this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter . Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts . Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes . ( Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac , says Ramsey . ) Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month . Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia . A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . The other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . Colorful , bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite . The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group , Composite . The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor . To bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage . Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile . The Vagabonds are `` on the road '' again . Members are on their way to Saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars . This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club , Saledo , for festivities . Invitations have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price Daniel . Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail . The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing . Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm Trail Days . Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women . The men will be in western attire , including Stetsons and colored vests . Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas , in tall bushes ; ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes . There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests . Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip . Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy McKee , George McElyee , Jack Fanning , W. H. Roquemore and Joe Darrow . The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto `` Go Somewhere , Anywhere , Everywhere '' . Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe . In the past , the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica , buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston . Four parties are given a year . Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity . Serving on the club's board are Mmes R. P. Anderson , president ; ; A. F. Schmalzried , secretary ; ; W. H. Roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : Mmes McKee , publicity ; ; Lawrence B. Jones , yearbook , and Sam Laughlin , scrapbook . A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . She lives in Wellsville , Mo. . Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . And the third time was the charm . She dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist . The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges . Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs. Norman Chandler , chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee , and Mr. Chandler . Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts . A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton Becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex . Foliage will glow at formal fall party Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening . More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring . Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William A. Thompson , Van Cott Niven , A. B. Cox , David Bricker , Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson . Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins , and J. Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson . Guests from across U.S. honor Dr. Swim When Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country . A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points . Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles . He started practice in 1917 , and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners . Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing . She put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in Budapest . Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles . Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna . There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . And there she had her first showing of tapestry work . There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today . What most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . Getting to and from school was no problem . They either walked or were driven . Now they go to a high school that is two miles away . One might think the problem would be similar . They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . It's much more complex than that . Generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . `` Why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? I suggested . `` My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois '' . `` Did you '' ? ? I was asked . `` No '' , I said , `` I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois '' . I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . I had to ride a streetcar two miles . Sometimes the streetcar was late . Sometimes there weren't even any seats . I had to stand up , with the ladies . Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . She has to have at least one car herself . I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . Even that isn't satisfactory . If they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . They say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . The logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself . The solution , naturally , is the bus . However , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . But that's hardly realistic . Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an education . Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week . Published annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman . Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . Stars for marriage Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year . Last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane Cooper , daughter of the Grant B. Coopers , to Robert Knox Worrell , and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard Pen Tudor . Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan McFarland Chandler Jr. ; ; Joanne Curry , daughter of the Ellsworth Currys , to James Hartley Gregg , and Valerie Smith to James McAlister Duque . Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning , daughter of the George L. Brownings , to Austin C. Smith Jr. ; ; Cynthia Flower , daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr. , to Todd Huntington , son of the David Huntingtons . Pasadena listings Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins 3 . She is the former Judy Chapman , daughter of John S. Chapman of this city . The young couple live in Pasadena . Another marriage of note is that of Jane McAlester and William Louis Pfau . Changes in address are noted . For instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly Rd. , are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills . Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd. .

And Lawrence Chase , son of the Ransom Chases , is listed at his new address in Oxford , Eng. . Others listed at new addresses are the Richard T. Olerichs , the Joseph Aderholds Jr. , the Henri De La Chapelles , the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton Crispin , the John Armisteads , the Allen Chases , the Howard Lockies , the Thomas Lockies , and Anthony Longinotti . Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones , formerly of Panama ; ; the Geddes MacGregors , formerly of Scotland , and Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Althaus , formerly of Switzerland . Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L '' , the foot of the `` L '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . Pulling strings Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . In this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . The scalloped edge is particularly appealing . Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era . A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden . Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . Solid investment There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge . The Cumbancheros , Latin combo , open Tuesday at the Four O'Clock Club . `` Flip '' Phillips for a return engagement at Fireside Steak Ranch Wednesday ; ; same date , Johnny LaSalle trio to the Jolly Roger .

Johnny Leighton picked up some new numbers out in Texas which he's springing on the ringsiders in the Rum House at Galt Ocean Mile Hotel . `` Skip '' Hovarter back in town from a summer in the Reno-Lake Tahoe area where he ran into Rusty Warren , Kay Martin , the Marskmen and Tune Toppers -- all pulling good biz , he says . We like Fike Al Fike , an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado , is currently pursuing the three R's -- rhythm , reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel . Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring . Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano , Wes Robbins , bass and trumpet , and Jack Kelly on drums . It's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie , it's Al's all the way . Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . He skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act . This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal . New owners Cafe Society opens formally this afternoon under its new ownership .

The business education program operates with the cooperation of local high schools and business firms . Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ? More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church . At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged . A young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force . He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing . Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it . When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it . The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church . And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity . So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program . This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; ; a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; ; and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days , by Ted Place , director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ , and Jon Braun , director of Campus Crusade for Christ . The second half of the film `` Communism on the Map '' and the movie `` Operation Abolition '' also will be shown . Response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon . And to encourage other churches to try their own programs , Kern said this Sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations . The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week . Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter family , 3181 SW 24th Ter. , will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church . It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies . The first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life . `` When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows '' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class . Until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home . They have five daughters -- Coral Lee , 5 , Glenda Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months . But after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories . To their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part . Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her . Dade's chief probation officer , Jack Blanton , will lead a discussion on `` The Changes in the American Family '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church . Mr. and Mrs. George Treadwell will be honored at a Family Week supper and program at 6 p.m. Sunday at Trinity Methodist Church . He is the sexton of the church . A family worship service will follow the program at 7:45 p.m. . The outstanding family of Central Nazarene Church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10:45 a.m. Sunday service marking National Family Week . Every family of Riviera Presbyterian Church has been asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during National Christian Family Week and to undertake one project in which all members of the family participate . To start the week of special programs at the church , the Rev. John D. Henderson will preach on `` A Successful Marriage '' at 9:40 and 11 a.m. Sunday . New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service . A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men's Club will be held at 6:15 p.m. Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next Saturday . The week will end with the Rev. Mr. Henderson preaching on `` The Marriage Altar '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday , May 14 . The resignation of the Rev. Warren I. Densmore , headmaster of St. Stephen's Episcopal Day School in Coconut Grove , becomes effective July 15 . Enrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . In announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . This work is no favorite of mine . I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation . Precise The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it . These qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet . Oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov . This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics . But , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned . Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . Hit Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky . Vladilen Semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . The production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society . The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players . Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; annual members may attend for $16 . Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ) . Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut Street , San Francisco 9 . San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children . Fire Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen . Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year . They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association , at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16th Street and Roosevelt Way . From the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution . Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San Francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 . Requests must be mailed in by December 5 . Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin . President Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said , `` We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . After all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita '' . It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . If that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fell . After television , `` La Dolce Vita '' seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night . I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week . I believe TV watchers will be bored . `` La Dolce Vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western . Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet '' . There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip '' . There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . In another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater . Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull . Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall . What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! As A moral shocker it is a dud . But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film . The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly : `` This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . And when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .

Miller . And you think you have language problems . The week went along briskly enough . I bought a new little foreign bomb . It is a British bomb . Very austere yet racy . It is very chic to drive foreign cars . With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back . You must also wear a car coat . The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive . But we couldn't really get along without it . `` Where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha '' ? ? Asked the gas station man . The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor . Gas station people are very debonair about small cars . When I drove a car with tail fins , I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases . My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth . This excellent foreign bomb takes only six . When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me . `` Tires OK ? ? Check the oil and water , sir ? ? '' They polished the windshield . They had a loving touch . The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank . `` What kind of car is it '' ? ? He asked gloomily . `` It is a British Austin , the smallest they make '' . `` Get much mileage '' ? ? `` About 35 '' . The gas station man sighed unhappily . `` What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? Crunch , that's all she wrote '' . `` I will die rich '' . `` That will be $1.80 '' , said the gas station man . `` The windshield looks pretty clean '' . Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! ! When I wheeled about , finned fore and aft , I was the darling of the doormen . Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely . With a small bomb , I tuck it between Cadillacs . ( The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself . High blood pressure can get the best of any of us . ) At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J. . Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . It is the AID's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . It will be painted to match the paneling in the room . The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project . Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators . Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston . President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C. . But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert . It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People '' to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House . She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her . As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner '' and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief '' . `` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them '' , President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl . After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said , `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States . `` This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House '' . As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston . `` The nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the President commented . Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District . Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff . Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . Henry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the `` Stars and Stripes Forever '' . Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring . He said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert . One of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . `` I was an art major in college '' , Miss Baldrige explained . `` I've been here so many times I couldn't count them '' . She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of education . Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's `` Alba Madonna '' and `` texture '' in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral . Everybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionist . Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard Bales . I'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy ' '' . Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards . In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century . A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra Angelico . The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 . They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order . The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple . A reception and tea followed . About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States . The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m. . A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington , one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria . The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . She accused him of ignoring her . He in turn told her she demanded too much . They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . Mary decided she had had enough . Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer . Family Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area . They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest them . For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . They are now working together toward solving their difficulties . John received a promotion in his firm . He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area . Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund . Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . For crucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . Mr. Kennedy replied : `` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting . Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . Road to Vienna The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. . That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement . On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident . The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . Pre-inaugural position Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : `` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . Attitude flexible At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . Deadlock on tests The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future . Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies . The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable . Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week . Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . The Washington announcement said : `` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . The outlook The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . Other allies consulted There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . Mollusks are a case in point . The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . This is not an isolated example ; ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . `` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . Adequate compensation is indispensable . Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . The committee remains unresponsive . Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; it must play a game in which there never is a winner . The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . ( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . ( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . ( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . ( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . ) If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . The problem must be faced squarely . If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; but many against combining to raise it '' . Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . The courts shared the opinion of the employers . In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : `` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . It was most effective against trade unions . In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . The law could not suspend economics . Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company . The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . ( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? ) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 1 ) Cuba . Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . `` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . `` That limit has now been reached '' . Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . 2 ) Laos . After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . `` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' . Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos . French & Indians . There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . `` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man . But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos . The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West . He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj . `` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' . Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day . The Congress turmoil in the House As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . Deadly deadlock . There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness . A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech . For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . Equal treatment . There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons . In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' . ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple . `` Unconscionable '' ! ! He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! ! Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee . Threat of war . As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose . His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus . The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer . ( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? ) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash . But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . `` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader . `` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . Battle in the senate The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech . Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . Republicans last act Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration . One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . `` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . `` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . And that is just what happened on the last few holes . The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . Player was the first to feel its teeth . After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . He bogeyed the 10th . After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears . He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower . Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt . Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe . The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . End at seven Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 . His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer . More than a streak had ended . Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . Player won only one . But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer . He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 . Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami . When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . Instant rivalry On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . ( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe . ) On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . The boldness of champions Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . Bob Jones played that way . Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . This day Palmer had started first . As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . `` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . This is Baseball 1961 . This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge . In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . Double threat : Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real . After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs . After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 . Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them . To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish . All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record . In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . ) `` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox . `` It has to be easier with two of them . How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ? Roommates : Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' . But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 . Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) . The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together . Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport . The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium . Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris . As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) . To an extent , the two even look alike . Both have blue eyes and short blond hair . Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York . Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each . Light reading : Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' . Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . `` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ? A reporter asked Maris recently . `` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' . This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken . But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . `` See that kid '' ? ? He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . `` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's . I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' . Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . `` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone . I'm angry '' . By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man . Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you . Send me where I can play '' . ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. . ) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench . Play me '' . ( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series . ) `` That's the way I am '' , he says . `` I tell people what I think . If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . Idols' idols : One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . Maris's was Ted Williams . `` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . `` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ? `` Are you kidding '' ? ? Said Maris . `` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio . `` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . But DiMaggio never said a word . It crushed Mickey . He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' . Mantle has kept the vow . Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track . If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine . But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball . They try to play baseball the best they can . Each is a complete ballplayer . Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . ( `` One of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris '' . ) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed . They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . Mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( , fourth in the league , to for Maris so far this year ) . Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base . Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox . Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; Maris's throwing arm is stronger . Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run . With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season . ( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams . Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place . Appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment . In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . Something was needed to revive interest ; ; the something was the home run . Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law . Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory . Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each . The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles . Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots . Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . A few of these people are still around '' . Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways . At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. . Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate . The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while . The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics . Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making . To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A.A.U.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete of 1960 . As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.S. Open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year . Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix , Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination . `` I'm a slob '' , he announced . `` My taste is gaudy . I'm useless for anything but racing cars . I'm ruddy lazy , and I'm getting on in years . It gets so frustrating , but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing '' . Has Moss no stirling virtues ? ? `` I appreciate beauty '' . One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 . Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because `` I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future '' . Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : `` I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh . There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause . On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' . He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures . He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world . All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city . But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block . At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . Break in Georgia The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . `` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . Catch for Chicago When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . But they were not . They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; they put much effort into public housing . They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . But almost all the schools were primary . The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! '' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! ) . The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . It is hard to blame them for this . Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . There were four principal ones . First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . Confusion became chaos ; ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . '' Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . ( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . ) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . Lumumba fired Kasavubu . Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . The presidency : talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . And that was not all . In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . Crime : ' skyjacked ' From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix . Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . `` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said . `` I figured he was sick '' . John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . `` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said . `` The other fellow had a '' . Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . Stalling : `` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; they would have to refuel at El Paso . Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . `` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . Tension The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : Take off or see the hostages killed . The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; the plane slowed to a halt . Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . The day wore on . At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . ( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . ) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' . Congress : more muscle Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . ( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . ) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . In other areas , Congressional action last week included : The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . Food : stew a la Mulligatawny Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . Tax-free returns . Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . Swelling traffic . A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . Slow successes . Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . That improvement is continuing . In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . Many rate increases already have been put into effect . Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . Easier access . Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . For some roads , troubles . Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . These , however , are exceptions . The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- `` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : `` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . About half of these are exported . `` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . `` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . `` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . `` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . `` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . `` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . `` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . It's an important clue to Washington thinking . Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . `` Get competitive or get out '' . In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . Government research will look into new products and methods . Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . They threaten to strike . The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . Some library boards are wary of the plan . A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . All services are given without cost to members . So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . The system passes on these savings to its members . Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . Books are not the only resource of the system . Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . The need for lifetime reading is apparent . Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; if we do not know how to use what we do read . We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . Only public understanding and support can provide that service . This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! ! Assembly session brought much good The General Assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened . It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education . There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers . The final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need . Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government . This session , for instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now . In all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed . Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action . Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue . No action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales . Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state . The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions . Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like anything but `` the empire state of the South '' . We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation . In the interim between now and next year , we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics . League regularly stands on the side of right The League of Women Voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive . It's a good use of money . These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but `` Keep alive their attention '' . `` If once they become inattentive to the public affairs '' , Jefferson said , `` you and I , and Congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves '' . Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs . The league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public . The harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in . And the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on the side of right . Look to Coosa Valley for industrial progress Cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development Commission . Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech. . Then a full-time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program . The undertaking has abundant promise . It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach . Rusk idea strengthens United States defense The Rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed . The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia's use of hers ; ; that theory was and is sound . The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough . By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war . This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war . It also weakened our diplomatic stance , because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity . This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity . By maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too , Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position . DeKalb budget shows county is on beam DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance . It includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance . That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials . Somewhere , somebody is bound to love us G. Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly . Touring Africa , the new U.S. Assistant Secretary of State observed `` Africa should be for the Africans '' and the British promptly denounced him . Then he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying `` American imperialists , go home '' . Chin up , Soapy . Power company backs confidence with dollars Confidence in the state's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction budget for this year . The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning . It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization . Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital . Actually it amounts to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars Gov. Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus . Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is . But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing . The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished . The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced . More attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired . Patients deserve more attention than they are getting . Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per day per patient . The national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low . Kansas , regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill , spends $9 per day per patient . Georgia has made some reforms , true . The intensive treatment program is working well . But in so many other areas we still are dragging . Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted . The boost is helpful but inadequate . The end of Trujillo Assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience . Rafael Trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history . But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered . Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination . The responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez , a professor at Columbia University in New York , has been laid at his door . He had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela . It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed . The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive . Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably . But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition . El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth . The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure . He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to Congress . Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character . Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression . Last year , after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean , the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him . Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines . Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines . But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans . There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba , previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces . What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle . The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed . Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger . The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom . Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear . For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help . Start on rapid transit High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway , operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John , Glen Echo and Brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city . In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council , the administrator of the NCTA , C. Darwin Stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching . Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area . Because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed . The NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress . Must Berlin remain divided ? ? The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city . So far as the record is concerned , the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so . Though Walter Ulbricht , by grace of Soviet tanks , may be head man in East Germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone . The wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` Greater Berlin '' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation . It was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet , American , British , and French troops respectively . After the Berlin blockade and airlift , the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin '' . For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas . Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany . That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin . The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler . The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities `` to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany '' . They insisted on the `` fundamental fact '' that `` the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status '' . This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact . There remains , of course , the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts . One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist `` vopos '' try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents . Another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass . The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed . Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about `` salami '' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed . Prairie National Park Thousands of buffalo ( `` bison '' they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland . A horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth . That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood . For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill . The National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County , northeast Kansas , as a `` Prairie National Park '' . There the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens . Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved . Grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them . The Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park . American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve . Whisky on the air A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on TV and radio . Starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations . Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power . The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials . Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy . Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition . Why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ? Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and TV stations that are not members of the NAB tends to spread . Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors . Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon . A law is needed . New York : Democrats' choice Registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization . In the central contest , that for Mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other . Mayor Robert F. Wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office . While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies . The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record . State Controller Arthur Levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city's welfare . They , too , have links with the city's ills . Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited . Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post . As Mayor , Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like . His election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars '' . Mr. Wagner might or might not be a `` new '' Mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls `` bosses '' . These are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote . But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him . If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made . The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party . Little war , big test Both Mr. K's have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos . President Kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow . But at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting . And Secretary Rusk , en route to Bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai SEATO forces . For Mr. Kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation . The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs . He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says . In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time . At his press conference Mr. Kennedy said , `` All we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn '' . At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position . Since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington , this approach might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the moment . But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos , the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog Washington in a tactical mess . As wars go , Laos is an extremely little one . Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day . The hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters . But for the United States and its SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th'-wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners . But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest , it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington . Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President . Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table . It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable . The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 , and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma . But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers . The road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain . But for the safety of Southeast Asia , and for the sake of the Laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made . The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives . A vote for educational TV The Senate's overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational TV efforts should be emulated in the lower house . Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing ETV and the House has let them die . But this year prospects may be better . The House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds . This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal ETV efforts . The funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation . The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value . But , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service . Other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment . A good man departs . Goodby , Mr. Sam . Sam Rayburn was a good man , a good American , and , third , a good Democrat . He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; ; Mr. Speaker , Mr. Sam , and Mr. Democrat , at one and the same time . The House was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , Speaker of the House , and second most powerful man in Washington . Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label . He was no flaming liberal , yet the New Deal , the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him . He was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any . Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word . Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction . It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs . The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical . His leadership was not for audiences . A growl , a nod , was usually enough . When it was not , one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented . He would rise in the well of the House , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence . He spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes . He made good , plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it . These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor . He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them . With his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader . He was , of course , in the House for a very long time . There are only two men remaining in Congress who , with Rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 . To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House . And it was the House he loved . To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition . The Senate to him was not the `` upper body '' and he corrected those who said he served `` under '' the president . He served `` with '' him . Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death . Woodrow Wilson , with whom he began his years in Washington , Warren G. Harding , Calvin Coolidge , FDR , with whom he managed a social revolution . And those still with us , Herbert C. Hoover , Harry S. Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy . He was a fighter for those of his own party . Mr. Truman has only to recall the `` hopeless '' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there . As it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration . With Republican presidents , he fought fair . He was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist . He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play . Under any name -- Mr. Speaker , Mr. Democrat , Mr. Sam -- he was a good man . un off the Congo track Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends . In 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle . Simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river . The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries . In other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga . Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that UN is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ? To the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence . Mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences . Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga . It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN support gives it . The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ? The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa . Right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga . That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view . The UN army is too weak , too demoralized for the task . Further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned . Last , it makes no sense to deliver Katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos . The Congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence . The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom . It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism . But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach . Otherwise , UN will march blindly on to certain defeat . Featherbed reversal A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information . The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year . Our comment was that this was `` featherbedding '' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement . The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life . Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need . Also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic . The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries . The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands . Meditations from a fallout shelter Time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side . But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in St. Louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there . It was , the brief writers decided , `` man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world '' . Peace , it's wonderful , and `` world law '' , it's wonderful , too , and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ? Meanwhile , in Moscow , Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism . A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon , where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink . While he was at it , the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide . `` Fools '' , he bayed , `` what do you think you are doing '' ? ? The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort . Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun . The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana , where , for some unknown reason , Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow . The plane was sent back to the United States , for a change , but Castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution . Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man , Che Guevara , who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas , Venezuela . The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen , who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium . Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes , but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests , these things would not happen . The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev . Pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away . The customer loses again . The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month . The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car . By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines . The board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws . A shock wave from Africa Word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe . As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously . It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues . His firm hand will be desperately missed . Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace . He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody . He earnestly urged a cease-fire . The story of the fatal crash is not fully known . The U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired . Whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined . The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader . He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice . He courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc . The Congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs . His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape . When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr. Hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence . He gave his life for his beliefs . The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing . It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments . If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice . That is the hope of mankind . Monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks . Too many have bogged down in bickering . Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual . So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity . All nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody & Company's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center . The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract . If the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue . Then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center . The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority . They allotted $500,000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged . Less than half the sum has been spent , since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations . The balance is being budgeted for the coming year . Unanimity on Interama is not surprising . It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed . The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project . County officials have cooperated consistently . So have the people's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels . Interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises . A short report and a good one progress , or lack of it , toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights . Much happened in this field during the past 12 months . Each state advisory committee documented its own activity . Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs . `` The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas '' , reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians , William D. Singer and John B. Turner of Miami . `` No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group . `` The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights '' . Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint . The progress reported by the advisory committee is real . While some think we move too fast and others too slowly , Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50 . West Germany remains Western West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on Berlin and unification , with a coalition government . This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national election . Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 . In order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength . Inevitably this means some compromise . The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired . Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the Free Democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government . Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him . If he becomes chancellor , Dr. Erhart would make few changes . The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise . He is dedicated to building the nation's strength and , as are all West Germans , to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany . What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result . If the party of Adenauer and Erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of Willy Brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve . West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it . The Free Democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union , and more dealings with the Communist bloc . The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility . It could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same . Regardless of the decision two facts are clear . West Germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations . And the career of Konrad Adenauer , who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began , draws near the end . Better ask before joining Americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing . But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself . For instance , so-called `` conservative '' organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where `` liberal '' organizations once took root . One specific example is a secret `` fraternity '' which will `` coordinate anti-Communist efforts '' . The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled . According to The Chicago Tribune News Service , State Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name : 1 . Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ? 2 . Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? ? 3 . Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ? ? 4 . Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars , Communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ? 5 . Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ? 6 . Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? ? In some instances a seventh question can be added : 7 . Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system ? ? If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time . Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green `` city '' of Islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future . The latter is what concerns us all . Whatever land you can see here , from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land . And what you can't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too . The public . The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment . In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours . In this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected . And until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing . Closed doors in city hall The reaction of certain City Council members to California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing . We had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public . In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the Brown Act , the Legislature declares that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business . It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly . `` The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them . The people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know . The full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature . Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act . Despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations . When all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations . We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims . Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily . But the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious . Help when needed If the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship . Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm . None of the Trujillo family remains . Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring . Had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war . Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba . Within the Organization of American States , there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously . But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting , `` Vive Yankees '' ! ! More , the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , Dr. Juan Bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future '' . Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over . He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike . In cooperating toward that objective , OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States . Matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 . Now , as then , it is a matter of jobs . Craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance . The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members . That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations . Or that's what it looked like at the time . But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs . Walter Reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the AFL-CIO , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor . Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as , say , Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters , is a matter of conjecture . But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor . Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds . The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive . Deterrent the Army , Navy and Air Force , among others , may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent '' to the spread of communism . But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the `` greatest single source of strength '' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world . Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the Soviet's successes in space . This shouldn't surprise the secretary ; ; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time . In fact , over the years , the American farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar . And thus far , Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief . The 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco . In exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage . But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer . The result : $1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget . Perhaps , as Mr. Freeman says , American agriculture may stop the Communists , but it is also swindling the American taxpayer . What's wrong at state A senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions . The department needs a clearer `` sense of direction '' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , Sen. Jackson says . The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department . President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance . But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes . Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy . This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates . But competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them '' . The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as Sen. Jackson puts it , `` in work that does not really need doing '' . Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved . Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress . Betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist . But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends . James P. Mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago . He lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora . His successor , Secretary Goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months . No betting man , Mr. Goldberg says he's merely `` putting my neck out again '' by predicting the rate will go down this month . He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods . Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated . Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing . The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November . The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared . Little resistance Cambodia's chief of state , who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia . But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel . `` I have to see the facts '' , is the way the prince puts it . And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture . Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions . Bottom sighted Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters . Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement . Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House . And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point . He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump . The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales . February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October , although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960 . Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 . In Newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level . Of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 . Another optimistic sign , this one from the Labor Department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments `` was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb. 25 '' . Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending March 4 . Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes . Well , we can't have everything . Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut . In New Jersey , too New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain . Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state . Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline , the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant . But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves . The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod , from Provincetown to Chatham , is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area . But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country . By comparison , Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable , for aside from the Audubon Society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there . But there is hope , for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space . The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year . Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing . But that heritage is shrinking even faster . No joyride much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver , the head corpsman . Anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to Mr. Shriver , get off the train right now . First of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling . It will be a 16-hour training day . Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different . And the pay , of course , will be nil . Despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else . The study of the St. Louis area's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside . St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region . Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power . Not all St. Louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood . But for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core . The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois . Gov. Dalton's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry . That is one approach . Another would be to take the advice of Dr. Elmer Ellis , president of the University of Missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri's economy . He says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy . The research center of the University's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about . He and Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference . The University can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study . In Southern Illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth . The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a $500,000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs . Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West Frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average . The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well . Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development . More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area . The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side . And then there is St. Louis county , where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth . St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests . Some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St. Louis county doesn't want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost . Metropolitan St. Louis's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi . Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and St. Louis will slip into second-class status . An excess of zeal Many of our very best friends are reformers . Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far . Take , for example , the reformers among New York City's Democrats . Having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall , they have changed the name to Chatham Hall . Even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? ? Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit . But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name . After all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-American , the days in which the Sons of St. Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the British government , that is . Further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ? They will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant . Instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black ? ? That might go over . The Faget case The White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official , Col. Mariano Faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service . The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds . The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista . Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro . Moreover , Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening '' Castro agents ; ; the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power . And while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist section , the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists . Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing , an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service . Gen. Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office . His official term expired last summer . Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania , at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get . Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 . At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen. Swing . The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat . Mr. Eisenhower , politician As President , Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics . As a former President , however , Mr. Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally , and generally missed his target . Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a `` juvenile experiment '' and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon . This was juvenile ridicule . Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad . His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding . The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of `` dollarette '' dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies . It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit . Finally , Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington . This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis , when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too . The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded . Ex-Presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words . Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein . Nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics , but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility . This is a matter of respect for the Presidency . Mr. Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship . Queen of the seas The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable British service on the high seas . Reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us . But the Cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least . A new queen , with the prosaic title of Q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary . The British government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger liner . Since 1957 , more and more trans-Atlantic passengers have been crossing by air . Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines . Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run . The Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons . This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months . Also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York . The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation . Mission to Viet Nam Gen. Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is `` very much encouraged '' about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army . Gen. Taylor will report to President Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet Nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources . There was good reason for Gen. Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time . Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a new crisis . South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year -- more than 300,000 tons -- may have been destroyed . The Viet Cong , the Communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories . The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November . Nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other than instructional missions . The Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when Gen. Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the French were losing . It is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently does not want United States troops . He may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming . South Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit last May . Gen. Taylor , the President's special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure . It is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the United States in an Asian morass . Gov. John M. Dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General Assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence . The U.N.'s ' gravest crisis ' Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N.'s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced '' . Of course it is . If the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- `` the first step on the slippery path downhill '' to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning . The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization '' . In other words , the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one . He should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world . The Charter does stipulate that `` due regard '' shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible '' . The United States and its allies have had no objection to this . What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U.N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come . The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them . Although the United States and the U.S.S.R. have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work . If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed . If they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change . The Secretary General must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions . This is the root issue for which the United States should stand . We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography . What we must have , if the United Nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition . What the new charter does The new City Charter , which should get a Yes vote as Question No. 1 on Nov. 7 , would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one . There is no such magic in man-made laws . But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy . Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor . Thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative . The board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions . The board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the Mayor's veto ; ; but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power . Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council , and a two-thirds vote . The Controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog '' functions ; ; his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed . He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the Finance Department . On net balance , in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office , the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now . Borough Presidents , while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate , lose their housekeeping functions . Highways go to a new Department of Highways , sewers to the Department of Public Works , such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do ( in Queens and Richmond ) to the Sanitation Department . Some fiscal changes are important . The expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the Mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department . The capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; ; but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds . A road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected . This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ; ; it will also correct some injustices . Enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow . Inter-american Press The Inter-american Press Association , which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn , is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years . The I. A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; ; and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution . As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime , more and more Cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile . The I. A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952 . Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances . In such conditions all freedoms are lost . This , in more diplomatic language , is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government . He felt able to end on a note of hope . He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms . No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American Press Association . Meeting in Moscow The Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced . According to the original program , Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the `` bold program for building communism in our time '' which the Congress will adopt . But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 , the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future . The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered . Whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated . And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive . This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years . The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress , and the Central Committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job . Dr. Conant's call to action Dr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer . His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change . Now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including New York , has shattered this optimism . Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry . His new book , entitled `` Slums And Suburbs '' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster . There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant's specific views . His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment . Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality . His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend . But these are side issues to a powerful central theme . That theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk . It labels the slums , especially the Negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters . The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike . The facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students . A call for action `` before it is too late '' has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures . These warnings must not be treated lightly . Dr. Conant's conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude . He has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad ; ; but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools . And now -- more junk mail A fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail . He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers . In accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress , each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district . This means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis . Our creditors do not forget us Letter writing is a dying art . Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten . Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter . Old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery . She had , she said , heard that the plant was closing . It couldn't close , she said . She had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat . She had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear . She was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter . She had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food . This did not happen in counties of North Georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land . Nor in South Georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields . This happened in Decatur , DeKalb County , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta . And now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb County cannery . `` Is it so the cannery is going to close '' ? ? O. N. Moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn't know what to say . He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer . He did say he was out of cans , the No. 3's , but `` I requisitioned 22,000 '' . He said he had No. 2's enough to last two weeks more . Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one . A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed . Reason : the cannery loses $3,000 yearly . But DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money . `` The cannery '' , said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory garden '' produce , `` is a service to the taxpayer . And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up . It helps those people who help themselves . `` The county , though , seems more interested in those people who don't even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food '' . A driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , `` What in the world will we do '' ? ? `` What in the world '' , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do '' ? ? Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn't believe it will close . But he is in the middle , an employe of DeKalb , but on the side of the people . The young married people ; ; the old couples . The dairy truck driver ; ; the old woman with the stew . `` Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps '' , he said . `` Sir , I know the cannery helps '' . Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard . When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , `` Just forget it '' . There is one thing I know ; ; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge . I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades . Several years ago I was his pastor . One night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God . After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land . `` We tried to settle this dispute '' , he said , `` but could never come to an agreement . I settled it tonight '' , he continued . `` I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor '' . Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God . You cannot wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart . Henry Van Dyke said , `` Forgive and forget if you can ; ; but forgive anyway '' . Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness . We must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure God's forgiveness . `` For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive -- your trespasses '' . Matthew 6 : 14-15 . It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong . Then , Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited . In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` Forgive us our debts '' . When a person meets God's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven . God's mercy and patience will last forever . Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God's love . It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past . We want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future . Finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us . Once Peter asked , `` How oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? ? Till seven times ? ? Jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven '' . Matthew 18 : 21-22 . Jesus not only taught forgiveness , He gave us an example of it on the cross . With all the energy of his broken body he prayed , `` Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do '' . Luke 23:34 . She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married . Her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said . For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia . But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute . `` How do you know you love somebody enough to get married '' ? ? She asked . It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked : How can you be sure ? ? `` Aren't you sure '' ? ? I asked , looking at her searchingly . I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important . But if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage . Besides , in all honesty , I don't know how you can be sure . I don't know any secret recipe for certainty . In the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured . I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth . `` Does he ever bore you '' ? ? I asked . `` Bore me '' ? ? She was shocked . Oh , no-o ! ! Why , he's so darling and '' `` I mean '' , I went on ruthlessly , `` when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ? ? Does he care about things that matter to you ? ? Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? ? Because , honey , I thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded , together . And if you bore each other then , heaven help you . She came back the other day to reassure me . She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting . She asked if I had other advice and , heady with success , I rushed it in , I hope not too late . Be friends with your mother-in-law . Jokes , cartoons and cynics to the contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends . I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well . But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St. Luke's Church in Atlanta . It was the cry of not just one heart ; ; it spoke for many in the clergy , I suspect . The pulpit is a lonely place . Who stops to think of that ? ? Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church . `` Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments '' , he told his members . A minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit '' his church , he wrote , `` for he becomes ordinary . '' And so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when `` I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you '' . His very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister , a modest Methodist , who said : `` I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and I would have it no other way : and it is unworthy to think of self . But oh , how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself '' . A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving . He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach . The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity . Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards . Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul . We press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and God's . We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , American cash . If we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins . If he won't break , we add to the stress he bears . And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to . We expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be . We expect bestowal of God's love through him . But how little love we give him . The church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners . Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too . Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake . The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure . The evening was not always spent in the same way . This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod . The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages . In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone . He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize . The prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging . Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement . Mr. Podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it . He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him . Suddenly one young voice rose above the others . `` But '' , it said , `` do you always know when you're happy '' ? ? The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind . Here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace . It had begun with the blue jay feather . Walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr. Podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight . The winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood . The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet . All day long Mr. Podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield . Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day ? ? Hardly . But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake . Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it . And there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road . It was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car . Would the driver see the turtle ? ? Would he take pains to avoid it ? ? Mr. Podger took no chances . Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , Mr. Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness . The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon . But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other . Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight . Where was the driver now ? ? What was he doing ? ? And the turtle ? ? Mr. Podger smiled . For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama . The three would never meet again , but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident . Then there had been the auction itself . Mr. Podger heard again ; ; at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase . `` I like them things , too '' , he had said . `` We got one at home . You know what ? ? If you're lyin' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you . I do it , lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it's all quiet . The wind moves it a little bit -- you know . '' Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice . As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , Mr. Podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet . Alacrity , the Podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up . She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe . Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod . Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out . `` Dad '' ! ! She said . `` It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire , and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one . We need you to start it . Why are you out here all by yourself ? ? Aren't you happy '' ? ? Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire . `` Of course I am '' , he said . `` Never happier in my life . I just came out here to know it '' . Dallas As the South begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools . Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta . In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment . These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully . The programs do not take sides on the issue itself . They point out simply that `` it is the law of the land '' . The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation . Even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs . In each case there was an initial act of violence . In Nashville , a school was dynamited . In Houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes , none of which were serious . In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents . The Nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South . It is a `` stair-step '' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade . Each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated . The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now '' . The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston . It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents . Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program . Generally , throughout the South , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met . Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas . During the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments . It was part of a citywide move toward full integration . So successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months . Hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars . Already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis . Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis . This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas . It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South . Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights . They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots . All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it . There are many causes for this change . One of the most important is economic . Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence . They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order . In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way . And as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up . This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation . They realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise . Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago , I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship . Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles , it goes like this : A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead . Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane B , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h. . The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him . He can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane A ; ; ( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; ; or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair . The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access . Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I don't know . But it is done , consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed . This could never happen in my native Chicago . There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood . In Chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back . Failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly . This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers . At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype . After three months of research , I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered . During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street . Miami , Fla. , March 17 . An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year . Now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa . This happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece . `` It's a whole lot easier '' , he said , `` to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New York city '' . And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher . `` That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote '' , said the writer , scratching his head . `` Now , if I can just figure out what he's talking about , I'll use it '' . Two spots open This was just Richard's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open . Some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs . It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn't worked that way . This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one . You'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 . Obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League , it will have to show improvement someplace . Where can that improvement possibly come from ? ? You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year . Robby could be better . Brooks Robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 . You can't expect it , though . Robby's performance last year was tremendous . It's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile . If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint . They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden . Hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back . He got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it . There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year . They don't expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat . He'll still be a top player , they concede , because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him . But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production . Breeding might move up . Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs . Don't ask him more . I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch . But even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won't do too much better . So , all in all , the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first . And the pitching will also have trouble doing better . Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season . Where , then , can we look for improvement ? ? `` From Triandos , Brandt and Walker '' , answers Richards . `` They're the ones we can expect to do better '' . The man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons . Triandos hasn't proved it yet , but he says he's convinced his thumb is all right . He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him . If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively . I'm still not convinced , though , I'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him . Hank Foiles , backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year , but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant . To me , Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year . He hasn't played too much , because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice . He's hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year . When he came to Baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club . He was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field . As of now , that all seems behind him . He's been entirely different all spring . And Walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year . Let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff . So , if the Orioles are to improve , Brandt , Triandos and Walker will have to do it . So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't seem capable of carrying the load . Of course , this isn't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city , but it's the way things look from here at this point . Is the mother of an `` autistic '' child at fault ? ? ( The `` autistic '' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self . He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people . ) Did his mother make him this way ? ? Some people believe she did . We think differently . We believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn . A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties . Sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them . But we don't think she creates them . We don't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic . The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem . Since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments . She wrote : total disinterest `` . As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy . He wants me to do everything for him . `` You don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them . But I do and my psychiatrist does , too . I know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself I cannot give full control or direction . `` One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned . This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and I . When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board . He pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held . Physical contact is uncomfortable for him '' ! ! This mother is quite correct . As a rule , the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others . Parents have to find other ways of comforting him . For the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement . As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic '' thing ) . Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick . The answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer . Only ingenuity will uncover it . What future holds `` Dear Doctors : We learned this year that our older son , Daniel , is autistic . We did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to . Fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children . `` I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal , though of course I realize he is far from that at present . What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible . I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible . `` What is your experience with autistic children ? ? How do they turn out later '' ? ? Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives . Certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood . Single-color use question -- A first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc. . When different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc. . The other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color . Should I show my daughter how things should be colored ? ? She is an aggressive , nervous child . Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? ? Answer -- Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects . This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade . No , coloring isn't exactly something you teach a child . You sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines . But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration . Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery . Possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed . Just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery . One such , in fact , is a rug . Though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background . The twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England . Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country . The work is executed in England ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color . Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color . Chinese influence For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period . Since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , `` is that of human conception '' . Modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend . These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts . An amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room . California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers' backyards . They seem darned proud of it . And they're confident that the GOP , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine . Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate . But it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people '' . Out of this session may come : 1 -- Plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country . 2 -- Blueprints for doubling the CDC's present 55,000 enrollment . 3 -- Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan. 26-28 . 4 -- And proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts . At the head of the CDC is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , Thomas B. Carvey Jr. , whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon missiles . He's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion . Viewed from afar , the CDC looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid : its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so . Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer '' Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the Aj . Moreover , the entire state Democratic hierarchy , from Gov. Brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation . Contrarily , Republican `` volunteers '' go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion . Carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase CDC membership . Where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth . Biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory . Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's favor , strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis . Like most Democratic spokesmen , Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year '' . Hence the attention they're lavishing on the Aj . In all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites . This bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye-to-eye with the Aj . Naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council . Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John F. Kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign , the CDC plainly intends to provide the party's campaign muscle in 1962 . There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov. Brown and the other constitutional incumbents . Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's most formidable foe , with ex-Gov. Knight a close second . But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much . In his CDC work , Carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists : former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren , who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk . ( Significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles . ) note : We've just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg. , which graphically illustrates the CDC's broad appeal . State Sen. Dick Richards will keynote ; ; state and county committeemen , CDC directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents '' have been invited . This is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes . It is a short course in Communese . It works with English , Russian , German , Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue . Once you learn how to translate Communese , much of each day's deluge of news will become clearer . At least , I have found it so . For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr. Freud , Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves . They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty . President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain . Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency . Now listen closely : Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England : `` President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism . Evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the West have been planned long in advance . The West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the United States to justify its arms drive '' . The Soviet news agency TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe : `` President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American munitions industry . When the stock exchange opened this morning , many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas , Lockheed and United Aircraft and prices rose substantially . Over 4 million shares were sold , the highest figures since early June . ( Quotations follow '' . ) TASS datelined Los Angeles , in English to Europe : `` Former Vice President Nixon came out in support of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race . He also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension : specifically to crush the Cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United Nations , and postpone non-military programs at home '' . TASS from Moscow in English to Europe : `` The American press clamored for many days promising President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United States . In fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President . If there were no West Berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United States and its NATO partners . Washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U.S. economy after a prolonged slump '' . And now , for Communist listeners and readers : Moscow Radio in Russian to the USSR : `` The U.S. President has shown once again that the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race . As was to be expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn , where officials of the West German government praised it '' . Moscow Novosti article in Russian , datelined London : `` U.S. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee . British common sense is proverbial . The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures '' . East Berlin ( Communist ) radio in German to Germany : `` A better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech . Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West Berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty . Whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn . In Kennedy's speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them . Well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over West Berlin '' . Moscow TASS in Russian datelined Sochi : `` Chairman Khrushchev received the U.S. President's disarmament adviser , John McCloy . Their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere '' . Now , to translate from the Communese , this means : The `` West Berlin '' crisis is really an East Berlin crisis . The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin ( Wall Street ) and the Red Army ( Pentagon ) egged on by the West Germans ( East Germans ) . The reason was to speed up domestic production in the USSR , which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards . Chairman Khrushchev ( Kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position . His advisers in the Politburo ( White House ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions , so he is not always consistent . The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin , and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies . The West has no intention of attacking Russia . Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy had a terrible row at Sochi . See , Communese is easy -- once you get onto it . Aug. 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded the Pennsylvania Gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post . The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C. Atkinson and Charles Alexander , who had just taken over Franklin's old paper , desired a more distinctive name . When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction , poetry , and literary essays . In the middle of the century , with a circulation of 90,000 , the Post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country . But during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus H. K. Curtis purchased it -- `` paper , type , and all '' -- for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2,000 subscribers . Little more than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the Franklin tradition , the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive . But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country . `` Remember the French railroad baron who was going to take me floating down the Nile '' ? ? `` Remember the night Will Rogers filled a tooth for me between numbers '' ? ? `` Sure , we met a barrel of rich men but it's hard to find the real thing when you're young , beautiful and the toast of two continents '' `` Remember Fanny Brice promised my mother she would look after me on the road '' ? ? All this remembering took place the other night when I had supper with the Ziegfeld Girls at the Beverly Hills Club . A quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy of walking dreams sashayed up and down the staircases of the old New Amsterdam Theater , N.Y. . But watching Mrs. Cyril Ring , Berniece Dalton Janssen , Mrs. Robert Jarvis , Mrs. Walter Adams order low-calorie seafood , no bread , I could see the Ziegfeld Girls of 1920 were determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961 . I was anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the Great White Way . All I could remember was Billie Dove pasted over the ceiling of my big brother's room . `` Billie was really beautiful '' ! !

But once the strike trend hits hoosegows , there is no telling how far it may go . Inmates might even demand the 34-hour week , all holidays off and fringe benefits including state contributions toward lawyers' fees . Some day we might see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates , with a leader busily trying to organize reformatory occupants , defendants out on bail , convicts opposed to probation officers , etc. . A three-day confinement week , with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation , with fringe benefits including : 1 . Wider space between iron bars and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of metal . 2 . An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks used on prison doors . In case of a deadlock between prison boards and inmates , a federal arbitration board to include a `` lifer '' and two escapees should decide the issue . 3 . Specific broadening of travel rights . 4 . The right to leave the hoosegow any time to see a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a trip to the prison . 5 . Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member of an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair a sawed-off bar without approval and participation of representative of the cell occupant . 6 . No warden or guard to touch lock , key or doorknob except when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with powers of veto . 7 . State and federal approval of right to walk out at any time when so voted by 51 per cent of the prisoners . The death of Harold A. Stevens , oldest of the Stevens brothers , famed operators of baseball , football and race track concessions , revived again the story of one of the greatest business successes in history . Harold , with brothers Frank , Joe and William , took over at the death of their father , Harry M.

Frelinghuysen , R-5th Dist. , had a special reason for attending the reception at the Korean Embassy for Gen. Chung Hee Park , the new leader of South Korea . Not only is Mr. Frelinghuysen a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , but he is the grandson of the man who was instrumental in opening relations between the United States and Korea , Frederick T. Frelinghuysen , Secretary of State in the administration of Chester A. Arthur . In addition Rep. Frelinghuysen's brother Harry was on the Korean desk of the State Department in World War 2 . Next year is the 80th anniversary of the signing of the treaty between Korea and the United States and experts in Seoul are trying to find the correspondence between Frederick Frelinghuysen , who was Secretary of State in 1883 and 1884 , and Gen. Lucius Foote , who was the first minister to Korea . They enlisted the help of the New Jersey congressman , who has been able to trace the letters to the national archives , where they are available on microfilm . On the job A top official of the New Frontier who kept a record of his first weeks on the job here gives this report of his experiences : In his first six weeks in office he presided over 96 conferences , attended 35 official breakfasts and dinners , studied and signed 285 official papers and personally took 312 telephone calls . In addition , he said , he has answered more than 400 messages of congratulations which led him to the comment that he himself had decided he wouldn't send another congratulatory message for the rest of his life . Sen. Case Aj , has received a nice `` thank you '' note from a youngster he appointed to the Air Force Academy in Colorado .

Kind Mr. Sam Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn is one from Rep. Dwyer , R-6th Dist. . Mrs. Dwyer's husband , M. Joseph Dwyer , was taking a 10-year-old boy from Union County on the tour of the Capitol during the final weeks of the last session . They ran across Mr. Rayburn and the youngster expressed a desire to get the Speaker's autograph . Mr. Dwyer said that although it was obvious that Mr. Rayburn was not well he stopped , gave the youngster his autograph , asked where he was from and expressed the hope that he would enjoy his visit to Congress . Two days later Mr. Rayburn left Washington for the last time . The 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament , the first part of the New English Bible , undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English . Since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the King James Version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible . However , Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced . This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901 as the American Standard Version . Then in 1937 America's International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages . Undertaken by 32 American scholars , under the chairmanship of Rev. Dr. Luther A. Weigle , former dean of Yale University Divinity School , their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised Standard Version , 1946-52 . Not rival The New English Bible ( the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James Version , but , as its cover states , it is offered `` simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship '' . Time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose . Bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition . If this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the King James Version . However , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars . One is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary English , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King James . For example , in the third chapter of Matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of Jesus , the 1611 version reads : `` Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him . `` But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? ? `` And Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness . Then he suffered him . `` And Jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water : and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him '' . Clearer meaning Certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with Biblical teachings , in the New English Bible which reads : `` Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee , and he came to John to be baptized by him . John tried to dissuade him . ' Do you come to me ' ? ? He said ; ; ' I need rather to be baptized by you . Jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present ; ; we do well to conform this way with all that God requires . John then allowed him to come . After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened ; ; he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him '' ; ; ( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version . ) Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount . To illustrate , the first blessing in the King James Bible reads : `` Blessed are the poor in spirit ; ; for their's is the kingdom of heaven '' . The new version states : `` How blest are those who know that they are poor ; ; the kingdom of Heaven is theirs '' . Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the English language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar . To a novice that is significant . In the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church '' which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop . This is not contemporary English . Mostly contemporary For the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ . Originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages . Discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the Bible . To have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth . There is one danger , however . With contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic . The only answer will be continuous study . The New Testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the Church of England , Church of Scotland , Methodist Church , Congregational Union , Baptist Union , Presbyterian Church of England , Churches in Wales , Churches in Ireland , Society of Friends , British and Foreign Bible Society and National Society of Scotland . Prof. C. H. Dodd , 76 , a Congregational minister and a leading authority on the New Testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the New Testament panel . Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet . That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes . There are many soft and light shoe leathers available . Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers . Softness is found in crushed textures . Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape . Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette . Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights . Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . Coolest shade While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color . In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures . Don't overlook the straws this year . They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles . For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning . The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue . Contrast trim provides other touches of color . Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan . Designed for ease Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated . At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture . In a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat . At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather . Flats have a scalloped throat . An electric toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom . The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth . In addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories , which means it is safe . The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in . The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor . The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own . Most of us brush our teeth by hand . The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men . The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend . In addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth . The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel . It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly . Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device . The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly . The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy . But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles . Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique . Turn over writes : Does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ? Reply : no . This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand . The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand . Steam baths writes : Do steam baths have any health value ? ? Reply : No , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder . An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . Sewing brings numbness writes : What makes my hands numb when sewing ? ? Reply : There are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders . This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer's cramp . Brace for sciatica writes : Does a brace help in sciatica ? ? Reply : A back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica . Cholesterol and thyroid writes : Does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ? Reply : no . It usually goes up . The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body . It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish . The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed . The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue . There's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's first experiment in recorded sound . Edison could hardly have guessed , however , that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo . If the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records . And he will avoid eye-strain in the process . Everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable . For sheer ambition , take the Decca series titled modestly `` Wisdom '' . Volumes One and Two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day '' . These sages include poet Carl Sandburg , statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz , in Volume One , and playwright Sean O'Casey , David Ben-Gurion , philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd Wright in the second set . Hugh Downs is heard interviewing Wright , for an added prestige fillip . There's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications . Dover `` publishes '' what the company calls `` Listen And Learn '' Productions designed to teach foreign languages . Previous presentations have been on French , Spanish , Russian , Italian , German and Japanese . But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries '' , and is now prepared to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings . The respective vocabularies `` essential for travel '' are available in separate albums . Thanks to Spoken Arts Records , history buffs may hear Lincoln's `` most memorable speeches and letters '' in a two-disc set , interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P. Basler . As a contemporary bonus , the set includes Carl Sandburg's address at a joint session of Congress , delivered on Lincoln's birthday two years ago . For those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it '' , the Library of Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work . The program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of Congress , Washington 25 , D.C. . A catalogue is available on request . Newest on the list are John Ciardi , W. D. Snodgrass , I. A. Richards , Oscar Williams , Robert Hillyer , John Hall Wheelock , Stephen Vincent Benet , Edwin Muir , John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim . Two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above . Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . RCA Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` Adventures In Music '' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools . Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two . Teaching guides are included with each record . In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert A. Leggett , banker-editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona Progress '' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes . Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000 profit on the stock market . Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough . People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest . He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication . The child understands no . He senses his mother's disapproval . But explanations leave him confused and unmoved . If his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast . It motivates his behavior . He wants Mommy to think him a good boy . He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily . This breaks his heart . He wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother's little helper . But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them . His own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed . It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it . The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old . What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ? She can decrease the number of temptations . She can remove all knick-knacks within reach . The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be . She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . If he can't play with Mommy's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own . If Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not . Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove . During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience . She tells him of the consequences of his behavior . If he bites a playmate she says , `` Danny won't like you '' . If he snatches a toy , she says , `` Caroline wants her own truck just as you do '' . There is no use trying to `` Explain '' to a 2-year-old . Actions speak louder . Remove temptations . Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act . He won't submit to his natural desires all the time , and it's Mother's love that is responsible for his good behavior . This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` Homecoming Day '' . They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes . The football opponent on homecoming is , of course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor's lions . It is true , of course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now and then the Christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team . Even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them . More often than not , as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain . He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall . Undergraduates It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come along , oblivious of him , or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances , such as they would give a tethered goat . Usually , they titter loudly after they have passed by . His dream goes . He feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat that is on him . His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous . His bifocals blur . His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths . Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth . It is not much better if he meets with old classmates . Too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by . He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him . If they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done . After all , when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children , and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it . Middle-aged spread By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread ; ; the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy ; ; the fading signs of old beauty ; ; the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then , it is time to break it up and move on . It is , if anything , worse on the old player He sits in the stands and he doesn't like that . Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd . He always feels lonely . A team feels something . On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him . In the stands he is lonely and lost , no matter how many are about him . He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped ; ; the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants ; ; the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face . He remembers the desperate , panting breath ; ; the long runs on the kick-offs ; ; the hard , jolting tackles ; ; the breakthrough ; ; the desperate agony of goal-line stands . And so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth . But it is no use . It is gone . No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again . Since the obvious is not always true , the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities . Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more , Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14 . There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election . These are New York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Maryland , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois and Minnesota . In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower won all but Missouri . Yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr. Kennedy . Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia . Mr. Nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so . His visit to Warsaw , Poland , after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial . Yet , the GOP breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` Polish '' vote ; ; 30 per cent of the `` Irish '' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` Negro '' vote . ' task force ' A GOP `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities . The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders . These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment . This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one '' , and not a reality . The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical . They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics , which the GOP declared it to be . The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery . Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing , a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point . If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities . Errors repeated The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s . In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover , and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash . The Republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble . Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` Hoover carts '' . Smokers reduced to `` the makings '' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` Hoover dust '' . One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error . But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy . That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business . The most articulate Republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy , already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care . If they also defeat the school bill , the GOP task force won't have much research to do . It will early know why the party won't win back city votes . The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider . The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner . After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative Forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history . Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions . Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever . And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor's race '' ? ? How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations ? ? The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual . But when former Gov. Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov. Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November , the situation was aggravated . Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation . To have refused would have been political suicide . And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside . The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates . It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' . But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no , and he didn't mince any words . `` They are just asking too much '' , he said . We can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either . There are other dangers : Politics is an accelerating game . `` If an opponent accuses you of lying , don't deny it . Say he is a horse thief '' , runs an old adage . These men are spenders . If either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end . Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths . The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one . Why not have them travel the state in November debating ? ? It would present a forum for them in almost every community . But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin . There is a way out of this . The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum . It has arranged a campaign for governor . If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state . But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race . Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a `` great soldier '' . Ike's somewhat like George Washington . Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy . Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President Kennedy so much , they're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice -- and give up his program . Slogan of the John Birch Society : `` Paddle your own canoe . The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist '' . A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election on the religious issue . Too many people were afraid if the GOP won , they'd have to spend all their time praying . The Providence Journal editorial ( Jan. 25 ) entitled `` East Greenwich Faces A Housing Development Problem '' points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours . Your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning . First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested . This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town . The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come . This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants '' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites '' . What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development . It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs . Bostitch , Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax . The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory . The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars . With our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant '' as the best way to meet these problems . In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure . As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow . Mr. Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said : `` If this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain '' . He went on to say : `` In the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities . It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be '' . While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth . We in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year . It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase . If they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ? ? Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ? ? I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life . The `` fruitful course '' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called . For example : 1 . The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police Department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities . 2 . The East Greenwich Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich . 3 . The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money , as do other Kent County communities , for the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital , a regional facility . 4 . The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment . 5 . Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich . 6 . East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves . 7 . The education program for retarded children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community . I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as East Greenwich . I believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts ; ; and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised . These programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow . We have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions . Until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny . I would like very much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund . It is indeed true , as stated in the famous novel of our day , `` For Whom The Bell Tolls '' , that `` no man is an island , entirely of itself ; ; every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main '' . Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Irving J. Fain , president of the Temple Beth El ; ; Rev. DeWitt Clemens , pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church ; ; Mr. Felix Miranda , of the Imperial Knife Co. ; ; and to Mrs. Rozella Switzer , regional director of The National Conference of Christians and Jews , who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund . It is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man , and therefore , that most people are noble , helpful and good . Bless you my friends , for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality . I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School . My future plans are to become a language teacher . Of course , having this desire , I am very interested in education . A few weeks ago , I read in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston . The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over , and must not be going to high school to attend these classes . The following week , I read in the Sunday paper that the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade . I wish you could see the situation as I see it . If Russian pupils have to take these languages , how come American students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? ? I do not think that America is like Russia , not in the least ! ! I am proud of my country , the small city I live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school ; ; but I am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language but is not old enough . Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students . Well , there lies your answer . At the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency . However , the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation . Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me . The concern they felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful . The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather . Had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps I would not be here to commend them at this time . Many thanks for a job well done . The Providence Sunday Journal article ( Jan. 29 ) asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news . Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page . On the question of admission to Veterans Administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service . It can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later . There is one other point we should never lose sight of : Many veterans who enter VA hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected . No psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years . The arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public . I believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to VA hospitals . But I don't believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients . This matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans . Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long . There's a reason for this length of stay . First of all , the admitting physician in the VA hospital gets the patient as a new patient . He has no experience with this veteran's previous medical record . If the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient . As a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient . Secondly , the VA physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient . So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery . The American public must be presented with the facts concerning VA hospitalization . The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a VA hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other . The responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a VA hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital . An adequate system of VA hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals . It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is once more upon us . The American Medical Association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer . Do they , the A.M.A. , offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? ? We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness . Nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A. on the health problem confronting the aged . They opposed the Forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ; ; yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate . `` A lousy job '' Chicago , Aug. 9 -- No doubt there have been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White House has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic . This we can sympathetically understand . But no President ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job '' ( as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen. Barry Goldwater ) . During his aggressive campaign to win his present position , Mr. Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's `` prestige '' abroad . What does he think a remark like this `` lousy '' one does to our prestige and morale ? ? If the President of the United States really feels he won himself a `` lousy job '' , then heaven help us all . Questions shelters Evansville , Ind. , Aug. 5 -- Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars . Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection ? ? Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time . The scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter . This sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe . Let us prepare for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization . Short shorts on the campus Chicago , Aug. 4 -- It seems college isn't what it should be . I refer to the attire worn by the students . Upon a visit to a local junior college last week , I was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing Bermuda shorts . Is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years ? ? Education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so ? ? It looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves . High school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students . Many high school students go past my house every day , and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen . No matter how hot the day , they are dressed properly and not in shorts . Masaryk award Chicago , Aug. 9 -- The granting of the Jan Masaryk award August 13 to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities . Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk , and against principles Masaryk died to uphold . Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and for the destruction of individual freedom ( public housing , foreign aid , etc. ) . Subsidies from CTA Oak Park , Aug. 8 -- In Today's `` Voice '' , the CTA is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens . Rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly , and I would be the last to say they should not receive consideration . But why is it the special responsibility of the CTA to help these people ? ? Why should CTA regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should ? ? The welfare of citizens , old and young , is the responsibility of the community , not only of that part of it that rides the Aj . CTA regulars already subsidize transportation for school children , policemen , and firemen . Marketing meat Chicago , Aug. 9 -- In reply to a letter in Today's `` Voice '' urging the sale of meat after 6 p.m. , I wish to state the other side of the story . I am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market . My husband's hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends . Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and Sundays , too , for this is coming . There is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required . If a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available . We are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not . Most women , in this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower . Also , many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them . Independent market owners work six days a week ; ; and my husband hasn't had a vacation in 14 years . No , we are not greedy . But if we closed the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block . The meat cutters' union , which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets . What it is trying to do is to protect the little man , too , as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being made by the consumer , not the store . The Legion Convention and Sidney Holzman Chicago , Aug. 9 -- I , too , congratulate the American Legion , of which I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years , on the recent state convention . I regret that Bertha Madeira ( Today's `` Voice '' ) obtained incorrect information . Had I been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the matter she raised would have been clarified . The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the American flag . Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this . The resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag . It was my desire to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this . My discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them . At no time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties . Teaching the handicapped Chicago , Aug. 7 -- The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and DePaul University of the establishment of the Institute for Special Education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children . In these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field . The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in Illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children . From Candlelight Club Minneapolis , Aug. 7 -- I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed your June 25 article on Liberace , and to thank you for it . Please do put more pictures and articles in about Liberace , as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person . More school , less pay Chicago , Aug. 7 -- Is this , perhaps , one of the things that is wrong with our country ? ? Engineering graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school's history -- $550 a month . My son , who has completed two years in engineering school , has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer . At a rate of $3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately $580 a month . Ironic , is it not , that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer ? ? The Dupont case ( Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ) . Washington , Aug. 4 -- Your July 26 editorial regarding the position of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on prospective tax relief for DuPont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact . As a result , your criticism of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Department of Justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair . The editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on DuPont stockholders , in connection with the United States Supreme Court ruling that DuPont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings . These proposals would reduce the amount of tax that DuPont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars . Congressman Wilbur D. Mills , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , asked the Department of Justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement . The Attorney General responded by letter dated July 19 . Copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public . In this letter , Mr. Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments . There are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the Congress , not the Department of Justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation . Yet your editorial said : `` Now the Attorney General writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of this proportion ' '' . What Mr. Kennedy , in fact , wrote was : `` It is the Department's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion '' . The editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted Mr. Kennedy's views . The headline is offensive , particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial . Congresswoman Church Wilmette , Aug. 7 -- I concur most heartily with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen. Dirksen and Sen. Douglas . But when you write to Congresswoman Church , bless her heart , your letter is answered fully and completely . Should she disagree , she explains why in detail . When she agrees , you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged . I think we have the hardest working , best representative in Congress . Harmful drinks Downers Grove , Aug. 8 -- A recent news story reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks . They do our country great harm by such actions . Those in the public eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad . The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra and Martin to guzzle . Toward socialism Providence , Aug. 5 -- Overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation's main industries . In covert socialism -- toward which America is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them . In order to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise . This is a step toward overt socialism . Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions . `` Workers of the party '' to the editor : Sir -- We are writing in reference to a recent `` suggestion '' made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) . The day before Election Day , to which we are entitled as a legal holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party '' . Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this wasn't a function of our position . Such tactics reek of totalitarianism ! ! As we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes . To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation . We , therefore , considered the `` suggestion '' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , Bill of Rights , etc. . Our only obligation for this day is to vote , free of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public . This is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the United States . `` Plus-one '' shelters to the editor : Sir -- I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters . Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready to demand that `` the community '' help and protect them ? ? Community shelters are , of course , necessary for those having no space for shelter . If in a town of 2,000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent . In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants , `` plus-one '' -- so he will be able to take in a stranger . I hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one '' shelter club . Escape to the editor : Sir -- People continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space . It's simple enough from my point of view . I am for it . It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's world . Supports Katanga to the editor : Sir -- When the colonies decided upon freedom from England , we insisted , through the Declaration of Independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity . It is high time the United States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga . In the United Nations Charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle . This , again , applies to Katanga . The people of Katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine Gizenga , and his cohorts . By political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so . The United States and the U.N. denounce their own principles when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the Katangans . County college costs to the editor : Sir -- Permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to . The bill which passed the Assembly last May and is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny . The procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers . Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed ; ; none will be elected . The trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate . This board will consist of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders . It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes '' . The approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college . Since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue . This is taxation without representation . Taxing improvements to the editor : Sir -- Your editorial , `` Housing Speedup '' , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems . The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions . Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties . Then see what a boom in all trades , as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen . Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift . `` Natural causes '' to the editor : Sir -- An old man is kicked to death by muggers . The medical examiner states that death was due to `` natural causes '' . I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York , it is listed as `` death due to natural causes '' . Praises exhibit to the editor : Sir -- Every resident of this city should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit `` Our Changing Skyline in Newark '' . It will be at the museum until March 30 . It is a revelation of what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans , models and pictures . It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly make every Newarker proud of this city . It should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit . Parkway courtesy to the editor : Sir -- I hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway . Recently I traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere . One even gave my little dog a biscuit . It was very refreshing . `` Deep Peep Show '' The viewers of the `` Deep Peep Show '' at 15th and M Streets NW have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp . Twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered . This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing . The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay . Some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments . Although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure . In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time . These microfossils indicate the swamp was `` formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing . The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported in The Washington Post , August 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger . Working for peace Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air . While I respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that I would like to question . 1 . He said , `` Let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression '' . I would ask , `` Why not do both '' ? ? Military power does not cause war ; ; war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people . Are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves Friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ? 2 . As to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone . Is this a reason for saving no one ? ? Would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ? ? 3 . The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face . If the world comes to this , wouldn't it be the very time when courage and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ? ? Many of our young people think it would . 4 . Lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it `` Civilian Defense '' . In 1950 , Public Law 920 created Civil Defense ( different from Civilian-groups of World War 2 ) , a responsibility of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade . Far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence . Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ? Pets in apartments It seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs . I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide . In addition , would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ? I grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ? ? I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments . Sidewalk cafes Use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? ? Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal ? ? Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists' comfort ? ? Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended . The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak . Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? ? Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season . As an added suggestion to balance the budget , the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington Monument . It is visible throughout the city , and men from Madison Ave. would jump at the chance . Sen. Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart . He , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors . Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens . Let us , like the French , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd . Dissenting views of senators Two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee ( May 2 ) by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work . For a neutral Germany Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism to the editor of the New York Times : For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity . The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations . Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations . President Kennedy was right when he said , `` We shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate '' . I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East . It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war . The fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs . We have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war . We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin . It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us . But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany . Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation . In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated . Probable agreement The truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism . Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse . Actually , the Communists , out of fear of a united and armed Germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U.N. . If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed Germany , it might well be advantageous for the German people in this nuclear age . It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation . France and other Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany . If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria . President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` Operation Survival '' which has many facets . Why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States ? ? A united Germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world . Meeting U.N. obligations to the editor of the New York Times : In your editorial of Sept. 30 `` The Smoldering Congo '' you make the following comment : `` Far too many states are following the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments . It is up to the Assembly to take action against them . They are violating their Charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion '' . I would like to quote from the Charter of the United Nations : `` Article 17 , Section 1 : : The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization . `` Section 2 : : The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly . `` Article 19 : : A Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years '' . The U.S.S.R. and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget . But they refuse , as do the Arab states , to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between Egypt and Israel , and the U.N. troops in the Congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations , but by a special budget . According to the official interpretation of the Charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the `` special '' United Nations' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the Organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter for expulsion . To aid international law Connally amendment's repeal held step toward world order to the editor of the New York Times : In your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril '' . Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice . The Connally amendment says that the United States , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States in a case before the World Court to which the United States is a party . If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction . Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States , it also prevents us from using the court effectively . Yet although the Kennedy Administration , and the Eisenhower Administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken . Our `` destiny '' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law . To achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect . What better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the Connally amendment -- an act which could expose the United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order ? ? We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment . For better subway services to the editor of the New York Times : Many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-Main Street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their express comes to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained . To the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street and change for the IND , this takes a daily toll of time and temper . The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation `` hold '' lights at BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street stations in Brooklyn . This `` holds '' the local until the express passengers change trains . Without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the Woodside station . Phone service criticized to the editor of the New York Times : As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day . In the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service . It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing . However , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators . I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance calls , etc. . Either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company , which does have a Government-blessed monopoly . Fair-priced funeral to the editor : I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled . The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price , far less than I had expected to pay . But the hospitals and doctors should be . Helping retarded children to the editor : Recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children . Hazel Park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school . There is no charge and no state aid . Kiwanis , American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support . There are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school . Reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass . They make beautiful objects . Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon . Southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) . The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile Road , Woodward Heights . Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do . Jobs for Cavanagh to the editor : I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat , but perhaps Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago . Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare , DPW and sanitation . Negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great . He should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night . There should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling . Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case . Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out . Educate the city employes to give real service to the public . After all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples . Church finds news features are helpful to the editor : At a recent meeting of the Women's Association of the Trumbull Ave. United Presbyterian Church , considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English Bible . Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the Daily Prayer and Three Minutes A Day , as being very helpful . We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines . Rude youngsters to the editor : Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence . How old do you have to be to remember when Americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite ? ? Why has this form of gentility gone out of American life ? ? How can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on TV without denying the children the use of television entirely ? ? Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern '' parents they have observed . From necessity , they are also inspired by the `` hard-sell '' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising . Dunes park advocate to the editor : I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area . Ghost town ? ? To the editor of the Inquirer : I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles . We have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city . Good for Mr. Trimmer . Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a `` ghost '' town . Defends big trucks to the editor of the Inquirer : I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn't be an Expressway . Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future . Mr. George Hough ( Oct. 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop . The trucks today help pay for this highway . They try to keep within the speed limits . Although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars , a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road . Out of school at 14 to the editor of the Inquirer : The letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter `` simpleton '' instead of `` simplicitude '' . Such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden . There are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates , but not for the dropouts . What we need is more vocational training in high schools , not more dropouts . Two wrongs to the editor of the Inquirer : I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! ! I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is . Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ? If an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it . As I see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back , the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary . Why do we need bigger and better bombs ? ? I repeat , two wrongs do not make a right . ' we tremble not ' to the editor of the Inquirer : Everyone should take time to read Martin Luther's Hymn `` A Mighty Fortress Is Our God '' . Especially the first half of the third verse : out of the race to the editor of the Inquirer : To our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Having led the world in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race . Are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us ! ! Why trust Jagan ? ? To the editor of the Inquirer : Just because Cheddi Jagan , new boss of British Guiana , was educated in the United States is no reason to think he isn't a Red . We have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own . If we go all gooey over this newest Castro ( until he proves he isn't ) we've got rocks in our heads . How many times must we get burned before we learn ? ? Russia and U.N. to the editor of the Inquirer : Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one . The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides . Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan , London or Pearl Harbor . That is why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war . Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world . Why aren't the Soviets expelled from the U.N. ? ? Belated tribute to the editor of the Inquirer : While `` better late than never '' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation . Had it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task . According to one report , however , Mr. Hammarskjold was considered `` too controversial '' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring . Actually , of course , that label `` controversial '' applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet Union . At Khrushchev's door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated . It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed . As has happened so often in the past , the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy . ' people to people ' to the editor of the Inquirer : Just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of `` people to people '' good will . If only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth's `` big problems '' would shrink to the insignificances they really are . P.S. . Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit , too ! ! Expressway answer : East River Drive to the editor of the Inquirer : Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway are valuable ; ; however , several pertinent considerations deserve recognition . One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea . We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice . They start on the East side of the Schuylkill , have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over again to the East at their destination . Bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings . Each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion . We should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river -- on the East side . This can be accomplished by several logical steps : ( 1 ) Widen the East River Drive at least one lane . ( 2 ) So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems . ( 3 ) Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges . One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent . ( 4 ) This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive . Shadow over Washington Square to the editor of the Inquirer : I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square : 1 . Take away George Washington's statue . 2 . Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators . There's no sense in being reminded of times that were . Washington Square seems not part of a free land . It may remind one of Russia , China or East Berlin ; ; but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington and the Continental soldiers fought for . The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square . The matter may seem a small thing to some people , I know , but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism The Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying : The Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This square . Fairmount Park Commission Does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance ? ? If birds don't belong in a Square or Park , what does ? ? They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature . The trees are their homes ; ; but the Commission does not share such sentiments . The whole official City apparently has an intense hatred toward birds . Starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from City Hall . Just a preliminary measure . If any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too . The City Government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives . Indeed no . Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive . Of course , in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say , `` How come ? ? What's your motive ? ? Who wants this deed done '' ? ? -- in this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men . One means to help the birds occurs to me : Let the chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one . Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn `` Abide With Me '' . We will know , and He will know , to whom it is rendered , what the birds would ask : not push-ups but stand-ups to the editor of the Inquirer : There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too `` soft '' . Unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness '' seek to do so with calisthenics . They are working on the wrong part of our anatomy . It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft . Ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies . When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation , when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft '' . America doesn't need to `` push-up '' , she needs to stand up ! ! Disputes Stans column business scandal views to the editor : The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit . However , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor '' . I must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals . The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan hearings had to do with `` sweetheart contracts '' . These arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes . A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute . Anyone familiar with the details of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders . Further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act . Escalation unto death The nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet . It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories . They predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting . The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our B-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece . Some time ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet Union would make them . He seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock . And now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side . Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ? So be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing . So escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds . What is needed , Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity . The escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . `` Only a discontinuity can end it '' , Professor Morrison writes . `` The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- Europe of course must be written off out of hand . He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take . His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon , Governor Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war . These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security . Escalation is their first love and their last ; ; they will be faithful unto death . Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing . If this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation . He has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges . But if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously . Not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere . Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps . When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural . Thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable . But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . The tide turns When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands , paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists . They are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners who are migrating . The flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic . West Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable . Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen . R. H. S. Crossman , M.P. , writing in The Manchester Guardian , states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 , but of 1,700 a week , and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a week . The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people . Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead . The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that `` The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . The gallant half-city is dying on its feet '' . Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer ( London ) . Mark Arnold-Foster writes : `` People are leaving ( West Berlin ) because they think it is dying . They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin . Berlin's resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed '' . The handwriting is on the wall . The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city . State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort , will not avail . Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful . The materials for compromise are at hand : The Nation , Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again . A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin . Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants . Vacancy The removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history . It is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead . A British writer , Richard Haestier , in a book , Dead Men Tell Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4 , , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob . And in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn . The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows . Contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope . In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands . Nikita Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself . The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of Communism deplores waste . Who will take Stalin's place beside Lenin ? ? There is Karl Marx , of course , buried in London . The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable . Who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ? ? Who but Nikita himself ? ? Since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people . Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life . Suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ? ? If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ? When a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put . If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . U Thant of Burma The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends . Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running , but France didn't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter . With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold , U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto . What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . He has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future . He is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung . U Thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr. Hammarskjold's term would have come to an end . Whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen . Mr. Khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ; ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents . In a sense , the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; ; no precedents have been set as yet ; ; structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it . But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong . To the hills , girls . No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade . These are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372 . Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ? ? ) left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading . Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley , Alabama . `` If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast '' , the account reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls . Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice '' . According to Friends , the unit was organized by John Snook , a former World War 2 , commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company . The girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck ; ; they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies' accessories . This may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy . The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means . The doctrine has never worked ; ; it is not working now . The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; ; it cannot bring them into actual play . A more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined . As the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real . Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst . All false gods resemble Moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice . But there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands . The annual butchery of 40,000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; ; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient . No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace . If the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States . But by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily . Yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical . Here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning . From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication . To avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners . Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4 , 1963 . The scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of Centralia , Illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census . A special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new African nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly civilized . The band should play the Rogues' March as a processional , switching to `` Hail Columbia , Happy Land '' ! ! As the trap is sprung . Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it . The highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do . Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better . Moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social . It would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put . True , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` Home-keeping hearts are happiest '' , is as disreputable as Socinianism . Nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith . Perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia , Robert Ruark's grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is `` all this gallivantin' '' . In any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith . Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason . Since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example . If we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25,000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson . To hang 50 Governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways ; ; so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected . As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race . But the guilt is shared by the United States , Britain and France , the other members of the atomic club . Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1 , the US and UK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down . As it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ; ; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies . The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations . So , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat . Shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; ; a holier-than-thou sermon was not . On October 19 , after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , Ambassador Stevenson warned the UN General Assembly that this country , in `` self protection '' , might have to resume above-ground tests . More recently , the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , `` admitted '' to a news conference in Las Vegas , Nevada , that the US might fall behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain . The trial balloons are afloat . All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood . But for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science's worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths . The scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly . On the one hand , the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern '' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the Aj . But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States '' . Then it added : `` It is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected '' . Having hedged its bets in this way , PHS apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all : `` At present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected '' . Then , to conclude on an indeterminate note : `` Nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world '' . Dr. Linus Pauling , a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not . After declaring , in an article last month in Frontier Magazine , that the Russian testing `` carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world '' , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons : The damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects . Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia . Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating . Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility . The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn . But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem . Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing . An illustration of this attitude is found in John A. McCone's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of The New Republic . To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout . A recent study on radiation exposure by the AEC's division of biology and medicine stated : `` The question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered '' herein . Of course , the AEC is in a bind now . If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests . So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague . Now , of course , that the Russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the US was testing in the atmosphere . The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold . After a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof . Things aren't that simple anymore . Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count . How much fallout will we get ? ? As of October 25 , the AEC had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of TNT ) ; ; and President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported . Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons . Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated . If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far . To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November , 1958 . Resuming atmospheric tests One of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself . That dilemma is as much with us as ever . The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests . When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security . This third choice was in fact made . With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken . Once again , the United States must choose . And once again , the choices are much the same . Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder . The first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the Russians . The second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere . The third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as Russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable . We take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us . It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable . Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice ; ; one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience . That is the contamination we most fear . Leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice . For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing . In particular , Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests . Speaking recently in Miami , Governor Rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests '' . Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the United States is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right '' . What was missing in the Governor's argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right . The possibility , as he asserted , that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand . Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary . Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great . Unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are `` compelled '' to resume atmospheric testing . It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable . But a resumption does not seem justifiable now . What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations . We now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake . This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism . Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part . There ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does . The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start . Ecumenical hopes when his Holiness Pope John 23 , first called for an Ecumenical Council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity , the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate . With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom . But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides . The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church . As it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses . Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective : each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy . First of all , it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity . Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light . Equally significant , Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity . A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity . Secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church . The establishment , by the Holy Father , of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern . The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as `` official '' observers reverses the Church's earlier stand . The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary of State , Cardinal Cicognani , for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act . Nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury . Augustin Cardinal Bea , the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches . Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone . For discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit '' . Can any Christian fail to respond to these words ? ? The budget deficit the administration's official budget review , which estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn't making anyone happy . Certainly it isn't making the President happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year . We sympathize with Mr. Kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either , although for very different reasons . Furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring . In the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor . The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received . The rest of the deficit is also easily understood . Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration , quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere . Four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr. Eisenhower . The farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the Food for Peace program and other new measures . Anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit . Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures . And yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up '' and `` economizing '' . We wish the President would remember that `` fiscal responsibility '' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election . The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier . Ethics and peace introduction of the `` dialogue '' principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington the last weekend in October . Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants , and when the speaker was a Catholic , one `` discussant '' on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion . Several effects were immediately evident . Sessions devoted to `` Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends '' , `` Moral Principle and Political Judgment '' , `` Christian Ethics in the Cold War '' and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves . Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader . In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which Dr. William V. O'Brien of Georgetown University , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy . That Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself . Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name . A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the `` divine law '' , while a C.A.I.P. member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U.N. nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent . The impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence . Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself . The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable . It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own . But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues . One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical '' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin , for example ; ; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account ; ; it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative . Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question . I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy . I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts . But I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy irredentism . Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it . And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : `` In America '' , I said , `` practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland . What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done '' ? ? He smiled . ( He always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather . He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions . I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's `` My Last Duchess '' . ) He smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , `` The President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei '' ? ? That , I smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one . I answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly . Chiang spoke again , this time at greater length . `` The President says '' , the translator came in , `` that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question . He says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the Mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant . So you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions . Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal '' . Fair enough . What are the relevant data ? ? For every person on Taiwan , there are sixty in Mainland China . If the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia . Relative military manpower ? ? Less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 . The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army . Say four million . The armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated . Skill ? ? Training ? ? Morale ? ? It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia , and the army the best trained . The morale is very high . Even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , On whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight ? ? The miserable people of China , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly . They think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else is secondary . But the army which Mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ? ? The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in China over thousands of years . It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization . Every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation . The soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ? The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed : a despot does not economize on his generals . But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews . Their privations are almost beyond endurance . In behalf of what ? ? Leninism-Marxism , as understood by Exegete Mao . To whom will the generals stay loyal ? ? There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm . It is another question whether `` they '' -- or a single general , off in a corner of China , secure for a few ( galvanizing ? ? ) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the Party . But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there . But there must be a catalytic pressure . The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal . The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years . The family is largely broken up ; ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous . For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan . Now the government must do that ; ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained . Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security . The second mistake is Tibet . Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state . A friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile . China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions . Red China is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed . Tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult . Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France . These continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension . The imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap . The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men . They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control . First and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime . On these they feel they can rely . Secondly , they depend on America's `` moral cooperation '' when the crucial moment arrives . They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly . I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day . He affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point . But he -- and all of China -- wears the scars of American indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are . We have been grand to Formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands . But our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive . A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the world struggle . The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike . There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation . The moment of truth is the moment of crisis . During the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures . The crisis burns these suddenly away . There the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look . The moment passes . New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones . A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies . Before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen . The measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels . One knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine . But I am here concerned more with policy than with men . Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain . Now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of December 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy . The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved . Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations . But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was in reality the principal . The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our NATO allies , to the entire Western community . By our policy the West was -- is -- split . But the key revelation is not new . The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956 . It reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ; ; at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ; ; in relation to Laos , Algeria , South Africa ; ; right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana . What the moments reveal This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows : Under prevailing policy , the U.S. can take the initiative against the Right , but cannot take the initiative against the Left . It makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue . The U.S. cannot take the initiative against the Left . There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left . We can attack Tshombe , but not Gigenza . No matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo . No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men . No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa . ( Even granted that the Congo should be unified , you don't protect Western security by first removing the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium . ) We can force Britain and France out of the Suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest . We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos , but not against the Castros . We can vote in the UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the Wall down . We officially receive the anti-French , Moscow-allied Algerian FLN , but we denounce the pro-Europe , anti-Communist OAS as criminal . In the very week of our war against Katanga , we make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship . As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-Western Katangans , we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our NATO ally , Portugal . What explains this uni-directional paralysis ? ? It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy . The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration , but only made more consistent and more active . Key to the puzzles Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin America . From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted '' ( `` neutralist '' , `` contested '' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru , Tito , Nkrumah , Sukarno , Betancourt , etc. . Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes . If we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible . And it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left . Broadway the unoriginals To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . Nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else's book . To get started , he does not scan the world about him ; ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . So far this season , Broadway's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays . Best from abroad . Of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ; ; The Wall , awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ; ; Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; ; Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel . The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents' clever but empty Invitation To A March . Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey , by Britain's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ; ; Becket , by France's Jean Anouilh ; ; The Hostage ( closed ) , by Ireland's Brendan Behan . Among the musicals , Camelot came from T. H. White's The Once And Future King , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi . Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce . The only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- Send Me No Flowers ( closed ) , Under The Yum-Yum Tree , Critic's Choice . In the forthcoming The Conquering Hero and Carnival , Broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( Hail The Conquering Hero and Lili ) . Dry of life . Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad . Some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank . And particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma! and My Fair Lady . As Critic Walter Kerr points out : `` Adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative '' . And other defenders invariably argue that , after all , Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too . The difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world ; ; most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own : stage technique . The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances . But that explanation is only partly true . Off-Broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original . Laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one U.S. original was on the boards , Robert D. Hock's stunning Civil War work , Borak . The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U.S. playwrights . Nightclubs the Cooch Terpers He : `` Come with me to the Casbah '' . She : `` By subway or cab '' ? ? That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan , as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian Nights , Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly dancing . Several more will open soon . Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis . The belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted Ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families . Customers often bring their children ; ; between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces . Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption . Small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open Sesame : the oud , grandfather of the lute ; ; the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ; ; the def , a low-pitched tambourine . The girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem . Continuum of mankind . If a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind . But a great many of what Variety calls the `` Cooch Terpers '' are considerably less cosmic than that . Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room . This is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic Karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) . The New York dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls . But they do not strip . The striptease is crass ; ; the belly dance leaves more to the imagination . When a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers' costumes . With tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary . Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy . The melting pot . All over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in Detroit , Boston and Chicago , and even in small towns ; ; one of the best dancers , a Turkish girl named Semra , works at a roadhouse outside Bristol , Conn. . The girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded Murat Somay , a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central abdomen . He can offer nine Turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more . But a great many of the dancers are more or less native . Sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U.S. , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs . As the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly . Some Manhattan examples : Jemela ( surname : Gerby ) , 23 , seems Hong Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother , was born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics . Serene ( Mrs. Wilson ) , 23 , was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan . Daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New York Casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body . Many belly dancers are married , but Serene is one of the few who will admit it . Marlene ( surname : Adamo ) , 25 , a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris , now lives on Manhattan's West Side , is about the best belly dancer working the Casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off . She has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the `` girls who just move sex '' . Leila ( Malia Phillips ) , 25 , is a Greenwich Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles . A graduate of Hollywood High School , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , `` a village girl coming in to a festival '' . Gloria ( surname : Ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in Italy and once did `` chorus work '' in Toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when `` we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all . But the ships are very slow now , and we don't get so many sailors any more '' . The uptown crowd has moved in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ? ? A short , tormented span Of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , Oskar Kokoschka , is widely known in the U.S. . This state of unawareness may not last much longer . For ten years a small group of European and U.S. critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 . The critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U.S. exhibit of Schiele's works . The show has been to Boston and Manhattan , will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis . Last week it opened at the J. B. Speed Museum in Louisville , at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los Angeles . Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant . His people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened . His colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom . But he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination . The devil himself . The son of a railway stationmaster , Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln , 14 miles northwest of Vienna . He was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork . When he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna . Even there he did not last for long . Cried one professor after a few months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion : `` The devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom '' ! ! For a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt , then the dean of Austrian art . Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter . His pictures were roundly denounced as `` the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna '' . He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle . For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters . Drafted into the Austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a Vienna billet , went on painting . It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show . Melancholy obsession . The unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay : his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded Vienna . He was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust . The children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic . The subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace . The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret '' report on Stalin . The publication last July of the party's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the `` transition to communism '' -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i.e. , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group '' ) in all theoretical party journals . These never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of Marx and Lenin `` full communism '' was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a Communist society had now , under Khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality '' . It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) . He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` All People's State '' , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater `` democratization '' of the whole hierarchy of Soviets , starting with the Supreme Soviet itself . Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy '' and would enable `` the people '' to take a more direct and active part in running the country . Also , elections would be more democratic ; ; there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from . No doubt , there was still a lot in the Draft Program -- and in Khrushchev's speech -- which left many points obscure . Was it the party's intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i.e. , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanized '' ) ? ? As we know , the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot ; ; and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes '' the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm . If one follows the reports of the Congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter . The Draft Program was interesting in other respects , too . It contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ; ; they still benefit far less than the `` other '' 50 per cent of the nation from that `` welfare state '' which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being . Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; ; and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary '' people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how `` communism '' is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food . Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? ? This was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts ; ; for he kept on threatening that he would `` pull the ears '' of those responsible for agricultural production . And , as we know , the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped . One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group '' -- Molotov , Malenkov , Kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov . Molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares ; ; in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev `` welfare state '' . The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story : what , in the secret councils of the Kremlin , Molotov had really proposed , we just don't know , and he has had no chance to reply . But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism '' and , last but not least , on foreign policy . The whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition '' with the capitalist world is in the very center of this Congress . Mikoyan declared : `` Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war . His views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the `` cold war '' or of an `` armed peace '' . One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group '' are not being used as China's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers . For something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated . The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov & Co. , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the Soviet people , from the `` epoch-making '' twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict . Not only , as we know , did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev's attack on Albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach '' to the problem ( i.e. , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic '' ) , but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on . It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends . The big question is whether , in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity , the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa . These seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident '' can now be closed . But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia . There are other symptoms . Khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence '' and would like , above all , the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ; ; he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-American `` honeymoon '' of 1959 . But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from China , but perhaps also from that `` China Lobby '' which , I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party . To these people , solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy . And the Chinese , as the Albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a `` shameful '' peace with the West . The fact that China ( which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative . And one cannot but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West , wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet . And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb . Was not this dropped primarily in order to `` appease '' the Chinese -- especially after `` Khrushchev's `` humiliating '' surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31 ? ? What does it all add up to ? ? Indications are that Khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the Soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of Berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world . The Chinese , North Vietnamese and North Koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , Russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation '' they would like to embark on before long : with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries . Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group '' nearly liquidated him . He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition ; ; but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life . He may support China ( but he won't ) ; ; he may break with China ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading China to be patient . The next days may show where things stand . On a misty Sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here . Eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare . To the average American , this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night TV movie . But to the Minutemen , this is a serious business . They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy . They feel that World War 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a `` last line of defense '' against the Communist advance . Their national leader , Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne , Mo. , says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught . In their maneuvers last month , they wore World War 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded M-1 rifles . The maneuvers were held `` in secret '' after a regional seminar for the Minutemen , held in nearby Shiloh , Ill. , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville , Ill. , and seized four operative weapons , including a Browning machine gun , two Browning automatic rifles and an M-4 rifle . Undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6:30 A.M. the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away . A 60 mm. mortar and a 57 mm. recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along . The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated . After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully . Here the two leaders , DePugh and Lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces . The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment . They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge . They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades ; ; and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment . Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting . Mrs. DePugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband's organization , participated in all the exercises . There were no `` casualties '' , but the `` guerrillas '' admitted to being `` a little tired '' when the leaders called a halt at 9 A.M. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane . Tenure as criterion I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk ( Dec. 16 ) . It has to do with teachers' salaries and tenure . Next September , after receiving a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program , I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers . I will also be underpaid . The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers . Teaching is at present a sellers' market ; ; as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers . But this is not the real problem ; ; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality . Hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary . I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid . It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases ; ; there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance . The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them . The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure . Here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses . Loss of initiative On the eve of the `` great debate '' on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition . What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate . Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others . It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs . A brief for the negative I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common Market ( Nov. 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join . For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand . The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare '' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background . The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule . In entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute ( recently set up ) or the O.E.C.D. , I.M.F. and others . To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking . If it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market , I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine section ( Nov. 12 , 1961 ) , by Mr. Eric Johnston , entitled `` We Must Join The Common Market '' . He says : `` It has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs '' . Referring to Britain , he says , `` We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in Continental hands '' . Since the goal of our international planners is a World Government , this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once American economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time . Frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel . Listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say : `` Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict . We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need . We would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment '' . But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or `` economic empire '' , but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years : an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry . Create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we'll compete with anyone , Europe and Asia combined . In short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either . If we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it ; ; not acquiesce to an international planning board . If we go into this Common Market , we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees , Connally Amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general . We welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market which JNR will be continuing in our pages . -- ed. . Mental telepathy ? ? The Peiping Chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on Monday morning , November 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the U.S. Treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed . A professor and the army In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in any further Army Reserve activities . Now , more than five years later , I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier . But , in spite of this , I , at present a man 31 years of age and a College Professor , have been recalled `` by direction of the President '' to report on November 25th to Fort Devens , Massachusetts , for another twelve months of Active Duty as an Sp 4 ( the equivalent of a PFC ) . Today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St. Michael's College . For , after leaving the Army in 1956 , I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston College and then at the University of Toronto . This time , added to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education . The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys . With this no loyal citizen can quarrel . However , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes '' . In my own case , I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking . Taken back into the Army now as an Sp 4 , I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am . ( A wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes . ) At this late date , it is impossible for St. Michael's College to find a suitable replacement for me . Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- I cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad . Mercenary : term of honor ? ? In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries . This confuses me no end . If the Hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for England in the 1770's were mercenaries , what shall we call the UN troops sent to the Congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the United Nations ? ? If the UN troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either . And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and Von Steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War 1 , and of Chennault's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War 2 . Modern postal slogan It doesn't take a Gore Vidal to tell you what's wrong with Cherokee Textile's slogan ( Pitney-Bowes Objects '' , July 1 ) . It's an eighteenth-century negative , man ! ! Suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment : By moving the term `` Republic '' to lower case , substituting the modern phrase , `` move ahead '' for the stodgy `` keep '' , and by using the Postmaster's name on every envelope ( in caps , of course , with the `` in spite '' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail . The impending death of Pope In the issue of March 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said : `` On trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian anti-Communist insurgents , U.S. pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia . Facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty , he said : ' I have participated in the war against Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu , and I have helped in the evacuation of North Vietnamese to the free world . I have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by Communist domination . At least in Indonesia , Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism '' ! ! Since then nothing has happened to save the life of Pope . I found recently a very small article in the New York Times : `` U.S. Flier Loses Plea . Indonesia Court Upholds Pope's Death Sentence . -- Indonesia Military Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence Pope , an American pilot . Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions . He has been in prison since May , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas . He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency '' . As we see , Pope may appeal to President Sukarno , Khrushchev's friend , for clemency . This possibility is anything but reassuring . The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters . But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope ? ? Are tractors available for him ? ? Does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot ? ? An analogy A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas Liberals were doing to promote `` Louis Capet '' ( The Week '' , June 3 ) , another analogy had occurred to me . Consider this table : 1 . Louis 14 , -- Aj . `` With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government '' . 2 . Regency -- Truman . `` A ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline '' . 3 . Louis 15 , -- Eisenhower . `` He opened his mouth , said little , and thought not at all '' . 4 . Louis 16 , -- Kennedy . `` Not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent '' . And Marie Antoinette -- Jacqueline Bouvier . `` The beautiful and light-hearted '' . 5 . French Revolution -- Conservative Revolution ? ? Truly , that Liberals should choose Louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the Louis 14 , character of their Grand Monarque , FDR : not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies . In defeating `` Louis Capet '' , John Tower's victory in Texas signals , once again , the end of the divine right of Liberalism . Confrontation It seems to me that N.C. , in his editorial `` Confrontation '' ( SR , Mar. 25 ) , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world : how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? ? This affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress . I know of no other solution than the one N.C. proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place . Never have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically . Thank you for the illustrated editorial `` Confrontation '' . It is both great writing and profound religion . N.C. has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece . I feel that N.C. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` Confrontation '' . Personally , it meant a great deal ; ; my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others . `` Confrontation '' should fortify us all , whether in Southeast Asia or the U.S. . Congratulations to N.C. for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace Corps . I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands . It would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into . The editorial `` Confrontation '' was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in America . I personally gained strength from it . Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world . N.C.'s editorial `` Confrontation '' is a stunning piece of writing . I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read it . The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know . Editor's note : Reprints of `` Confrontation '' will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the Peace Corps . A Peace Corps official described the editorial as `` precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers '' . Improper Bostonian ? ? F. L. Lucas's article in SR's April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New English Bible . I certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory in his first of the month column . It is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` Messing around with the King James version seems to us a perilous sport at best '' . Facts in focus Lester Markel is on the right track in his article `` Interpretation Of Interpretation '' ( SR , Mar. 11 ) . The current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago . We don't need this type of protection any more . The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media . Besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about . The accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities . First , it does not communicate . A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute . Second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous . The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation . Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns . Despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating . The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions . It seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends . The objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors . Southern California blackout I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's activities , so far as Southern California is concerned . You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions . To begin with , the all-powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences . I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President . Next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day . Up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 P.M. or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P.M. . Even then , a few of the `` less interesting '' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator . However , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on TV were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs . This is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary . The radio stations did run `` transcripts '' ( I thought ) during the evening hours . However , by comparing the TV snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored Los Angeles Times version , I found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( ABC removed the one regarding Laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer . I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the `` abuse '' he is being subjected to . We out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused . I don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country ; ; apparently it is not . It also happened with the Inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and I wrote to the TV editor of the Times . He did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this -- but nothing happened . Can you bring the networks' attention to this ? ? For a college of propaganda I was interested in James Webb Young's Madison Avenue column in which he raised the question : `` Do We Need a College of Propaganda '' ? ? ( SR , Feb. 11 ) . In my estimation , we definitely do ; ; and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die . During the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between . We had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck . There were also a couple in Canada , and several in England . The English schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching . Four of us here in the United States attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in England , Canada , and the United States . We set up the Lloyd's Neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there . Toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it . When the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust . We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so . Alas , no such thing happened . There apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare . A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there . And not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way . Congratulations on the article `` Do We Need A College Of Propaganda '' ? ? This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years , and I certainly hope it sparks some action . Let the media clean house , too many of us in public relations were flattered that Richard L. Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public Relations Association . Snow storm I was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published . Whether in his forthcoming book C. P. Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important . One should be able to get hold of the book at once . But the attack was made from an advance copy . If this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality . Editor's note : Sir Robert Watson-Watt wrote , on page 50 of SR Research for 4 March 1961 : : `` I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled , ' Science And Government . Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail . But I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard , from which the book was derived , and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C. P. Snow's incautious tale '' . Watson-Watt's remarks in SR did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures . Representatives of Harvard University Press , which is publishing the book this month of April , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date . The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt . Sir Robert Watson-Watt's `` rebuttal '' of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those `` falsehoods '' in an unclear incoherent argument . The article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning . It calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike '' a `` perverted conclusion . Nonsense '' . It submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles' account . We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns . The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party . But we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard Committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ? ? If so , I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the man . I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time . To the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it . It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin . Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed . There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat . Not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself . This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood . But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point . That is , when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr. Hendl could go along . But Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point . He flounders and lets music sprawl . There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms . The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture to `` Manfred '' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat . Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit . It got the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style . Bayreuth next summer The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch . Sawalisch also conducts `` The Flying Dutch '' , opening July 24 . `` Parsifal '' follows July 25 , with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting , and he also conducts `` Die Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 . The `` Ring '' cycles are July 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug. 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . Rudolf Kempe conducts . No casts are listed , but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano , Grace Bumbry , will sing Venus in `` Tannhaeuser '' . Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet ? ? Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet ? ? Well , now we have two big theaters . But barring a miracle , and don't hold your breath for it , Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world . Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did . The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in McCormick Place , which Sol Hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn't weep at the capacity , either . It was all set . Allied Arts Corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10 . Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory . But if you keep a calendar of events , as we do , you noticed a conflict . Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec. 8 and 9 . Something had to give . Not La Dietrich . Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking , fly here to open Nov. 28 , and close Dec. 2 . Shorter booking , but still a booking . We printed it . A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake '' . So I started making some calls of my own . These are the results . The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium , Los Angeles , Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4 . Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 -- barring that miracle . Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us ? ? Well , Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place . Then how about the Civic Opera House ? ? Well , Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4 . Queried about the impasse , Allied Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for the time being . It's all up in the air again '' . So the Kirov will fly back to Russia , minus a Chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country . Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium ? ? Paintings and drawings by Marie Moore of St. Thomas , Virgin Islands , are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows Gallery , 3211 Ellis Av. , week days , 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. , Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. , closed Mondays . An exhibition of Evelyn Cibula's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston Community center , 828 Davis St. . It will continue all month . Abstractions and semi-abstractions by Everett McNear are being exhibited by the University Gallery of Notre Dame until Nov. 5 . In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia Di Lammermoor '' this season , returning the favor next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don Giovanni '' , designed by Franco Zeffirelli . H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark , Hark , The Lark '' ! ! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season . If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find . Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics . Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm . Another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates' comedie humaine . What's up now ? ? Well , Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities . They want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers . They are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at . And of course Larkin has just the thing they want . Splendor by sorcery It's a horror . The name of it is Gore Court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot . That's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it , though . He conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air . He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor . The stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform . The vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch . Larkin has an answer to all that . The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids . Also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented . It's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . He doesn't really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange ) he makes them pay . For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot . He has a glorious wife and many children . When he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . One of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with Gore Court . He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands . And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it . They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth . First one , then the other If , in Larkin's eyes , they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living . Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc . Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war . First the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms . After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers . One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds . He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish . It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' `` Don Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses . More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho Panza , in seventeenth-century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . Nikolai Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible , performs the lanky Don Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . His addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world . The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue . The voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities . And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed . Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here . Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev , one of Russia's leading comedians , as Sancho Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too . It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons . The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court . But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy . There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` Sunday In Greenwich Village '' , a tour of the haunts and joints . Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary . At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for `` Chicago And All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC-TV Nov. 26 . The program came out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series . Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines . If so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents . As a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results . A few years ago a `` Timex All-Star Jazz Show '' offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland . An enthusiastic audience confirmed the `` live '' character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance . About that same time John Crosby's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do . In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods . The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music . Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work . `` Chicago And All That Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice of artists . Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden , Gene Krupa , Bud Freeman , Pee Wee Russell , Johnny St. Cyr , Joe Sullivan , Red Allen , Lil Armstrong , Blossom Seeley . The jazz buff could hardly ask for more . Furthermore , Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies . ( He played host at the Timex show already mentioned . ) One of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today . NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share . For example , there was sheet music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold . Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920's . However well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style . Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse . Similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal . `` Chicago And All That Jazz '' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either . Still , the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated . Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's `` Lucia Di Lammermoor '' Sunday night . The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic `` Mad Scene '' created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers . Her entrance in Scene 2 , Act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note . Thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' . She topped the sextet brilliantly . Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment . Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role . What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today . This big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined . Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly . In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently . Technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic . Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable . Her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine . The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio Varviso . He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years . He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult . Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice . His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction . The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable . Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959 . ( The first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia . ) She has since turned to Bellini , whose opera `` Beatrice Di Tenda '' in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season . She will sing `` La Sonambula '' with it here next week . Anyone for musical Ping-pong ? ? It's really quite fun -- as long as you like games . You will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new London `` Phase 4 '' records . There are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , Pass In Review ( SP-44001 ) . This features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand . Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect . All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music . Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time ; ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music . You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back . This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound . London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels . These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record . In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects . Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . Drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well . Only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right . They are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley . The Percussive Twenties ( SP-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods ( SP-44005 ) . Big Band Percussion ( SP-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn't have so much character as the others . There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies . The penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos ( SP-44007 ) . All of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise . Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system . Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic . Strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren't related at all . Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so . In any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter . During the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with . But , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge . The drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all . The storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic . Thus , in `` The Story Of Ruth '' we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic . But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i.e. , that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz -- the film version has little to do with the Bible . And in the new `` King Of Kings '' the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels . Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow , director of the United States Information Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry . He talked about unauthentic storylines too . He intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War . And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism . `` In many corners of the globe '' , he said , `` the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet . Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge ? ? Yet for much of the globe , Hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge . If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ? ? Francois D'Albert , Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall . He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College . His pianist was Donald Jenni , a faculty member at DePaul University . The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud . In vying with him , Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone . This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , Mozart's Sonata in A ( K. 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion . Brahm's Sonata in A , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists' strong , large-scale treatment . Mr. D'Albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato . He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance . A Sonata For Violin And Piano , called `` Bella Bella '' , by Robert Fleming , was given its first United States performance . The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada . The work's two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a Ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom . They might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood . Works by Dohnanyi , Hubay , Mr. D'Albert himself and Paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase . Standard items by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program . In recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium , but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital since 1948 . Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control . And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound . Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure . She played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures . The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century . It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best . The Rachmaninoff Prelude No. 12 , Op. 32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble . The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful . And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs . Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others ; ; Haydn's Sonata in E minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and Chopin's Sonata in B flat minor . A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist's performance . So , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing . Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing . All the generals who held important commands in World War 2 , did not write books . It only seems as if they did . And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written . One of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in England . It is `` Defeat Into Victory '' , by Field Marshal Viscount Slim . A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally . Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of `` those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger '' . The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the Field Marshal himself . William Joseph Slim , First Viscount Slim , former Governor General of Australia , was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War . He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped British forces `` were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled '' . He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas , Indians , Africans , Chinese and British . And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war . `` The Forgotten War '' his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines . Parts of `` Defeat Into Victory '' are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough . On the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book . Field Marshal Slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes . He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error '' . He praises many individuals generously . He himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers . Remaking an army to win `` Defeat Into Victory '' is a dramatic and lively military narrative . But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action . Before he could return to Burma , Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits . His remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening . He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many . He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there . For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly . Other crucial matters required constant supervision : labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too ; ; administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass -- British , American and Chinese ; ; health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine ; ; hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty ) ; ; food and military supplies ; ; logistics and transport ; ; airdrops and airstrips ; ; roads and river barges to be built . Expected of a commander Commenting on these and other matters , Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks : `` When in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder '' . `` The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty '' . `` It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them . It depresses them . So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it '' . Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders . Of the Japanese private he says : `` He fought and marched till he died . If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves '' . Brooding about future wars , the Field Marshal has this to say : `` The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him . He is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources '' . A bunch of young buckaroos from out West , who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir , loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience . Actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully . Under the capable direction of the choir's founder , Geroge Bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from Pergolesi's `` Stabat Mater '' and all of the Britten `` Ceremonial Of Carols '' . Their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing . The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat . But Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior . Most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words . The Latin , for example , was not only clear ; ; it was even beautiful . Furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music . Lines came out neatly and in good balance . Tempos were lively . The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish . A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly . Other capable soloists included David Clifton , Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson . The final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume . Boys will be boys , and Texans will be Texans . The combination proved quite irresistible last night . The Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze , after the region of Poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last night . A thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening . Not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied . There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification . The material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of Poland . But under the direction of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally . Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing . Since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company ; ; it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company . The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters . The stage is constantly full of them ; ; indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers . They can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull . To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed . There is , for example , a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act ; ; the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera , `` Strasny Dwor' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see ; ; there is an enchanting polonaise ; ; and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men . Everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth . The Theatre-by-the-Sea , Matunuck , presents `` King Of Hearts '' by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke . Directed by Michael Murray ; ; settings by William David Roberts . The cast : Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's `` King Of Hearts '' . The dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical `` don't eat the daisies '' material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it . The story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material . This is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart-secretary . John Heffernan , playing Larry Larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion . His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless . This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David Hedison , Providence's contribution to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox . Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role . He does , and more . But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way . A word should be said for Gary Morgan , a Broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular . And for his playmate , Francis Coletta of West Warwick , who has a bit part , Billy . On the whole , audiences will like this performance . It is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck cast does well by it . The Newport Playhouse presents `` Epitaph For George Dillon '' by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton , directed by Wallace Gray . The cast : The angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse , where `` Epitaph For George Dillon '' opened as the jazz festival closed . For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session . He's mad at a world he did not make . Furthermore , he's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips . This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards . They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well . It is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play . An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists . By the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells . Not altogether a successful play , `` Epitaph For George Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . It is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive . But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten . There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another . This is an exciting young actor to watch . Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch . Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment . Also fine are Sue Lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , Harold Cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and Hildy Weissman , as a vegetable in human form . Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste . Still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair . The Warwick Musical Theater presents `` Where's Charley ? ? '' With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser , directed by Christopher Hewett , choreography by Peter Conlow , musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky . The cast : Everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater , and Shelley Berman was to blame . One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , `` Once In Love With Amy '' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era . So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 , got a rousing opening chorus , `` Where's Charley ? ? '' , and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being . It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger . He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called `` Charley's Aunt '' , and let himself go with as appealing an `` Amy '' as anybody could ask . In brief , Berman played himself and not Bolger . The big audience started applauding even before he had finished . The whole production this week is fresh and lively . The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days . The ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by `` The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band '' , along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later . Berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy . Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky Amy , while Melisande Congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner . All told , `` Where's Charley ? ? '' Ought not to be missed . It has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , Mr. Berman . The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of `` Fiorello ! ! '' At Veterans Memorial Auditorium . The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott , music by Jerry Bock , lyrics by Sheldon Harnick , choreography by Peter Gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart , musical direction by Jack Elliott , and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott . The cast : This is one of the happier events of the season . The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again . I saw `` Fiorello ! ! '' Performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better . Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking . Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really LaGuardia come back among us again . Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican Party district chieftain . And Paul Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner , was fine , too . As for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction . Jen Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive . And little Zeme North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings . Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of `` On The Side Of The Angels '' and `` Politics And Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made `` Little Tin Box '' even better than it was done by the New York cast ; ; all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity . The party at Floyd's penthouse gave the `` chorines '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era's nonsense . LaGuardia's multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater . Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions . Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one . The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness . ( Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes . I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this `` Fiorello ! ! '' ) It has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater . Loew's theater presents `` Where The Boys Are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells . The cast : Since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where The Boys Are '' , but I shall do nothing of the sort . Instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- I hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex . The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual . If most of them weren't exactly specific -- well , that's the way it is in life , I guess . But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead . `` Where The Boys Are '' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy . There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid '' is performing . Most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar . Dolores Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable . I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask . A couple of the males made good comedy , too -- Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin . The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called for . I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it . To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining . The second feature , `` The Price Of Silence '' , is a British detective story that will talk your head off . The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters . Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking . To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment . For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series , under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger , Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius , not to mention the felicities of his style . And how he could write ! ! His famous criticism of brother Henry's `` third style '' is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced . His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor . Most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as `` that adorable genius '' . Miss Hardwick speaks of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship '' , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism . This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought . It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual '' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues . To his Harvard colleague , Josiah Royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , James could write , `` Different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly '' . Of another colleague , George Santayana , he could write : `` The great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book . Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it , I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page '' . Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- `` Glorious old Palmer '' , as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce , Santayana , Palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for '' , then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe . `` The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems . The world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other '' . The `` belaboring '' is of course jocular , yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God . To James this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others . But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent : `` You ask what I am going to ' reply ' to Bradley . But why need one reply to everything and everybody ? ? I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations . All polemic of ours should , I believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally . As far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other . Here again ' God will know his own ' '' . The collected works of James Thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows . The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known . About all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in The New Yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book . The one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled : `` How To Get Through The Day '' . It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the P's alone ) `` palindromes '' , `` paraphrases '' , and `` parodies '' . `` The Tyranny Of Trivia '' suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber . And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled : `` Friends , Romans , Countrymen , Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs '' , `` Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream '' , and `` The New Vocabularianism '' . Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases . A burlesque paean entitled : `` Hark The Herald Tribune , Times , And All The Other Angels Sing '' brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey . `` How The Kooks Crumble '' features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV commercials , and `` The Watchers Of The Night '' is a veritable waking nightmare . A semi-serious literary document entitled `` The Wings Of Henry James '' is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister , author of `` The Virginian '' . James , he remarks in a letter to a friend , `` is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions . He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities '' . Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation : `` So much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it '' . Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) : `` Woman's place is in the wrong '' . Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ? ? A tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes '' seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why . `` One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed . ' It's just a bat ' , said my wife reassuringly , and I sighed with relief . ' Thank God for that ' , I said ; ; ' I thought it was a human being ' '' . In a sense , perhaps , Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it Salvador Dali ? ? ) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen . That is , it is literally a picture window : you don't see into the viscera ; ; you see a picture -- trees , or flowers . This is something like what Thurber's best effects are like , if I am not mistaken . Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness . In his concluding paragraph he writes : `` The devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can '' . For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight . The latest Low is a puzzler . The master's hand has lost none of its craft . He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties . The reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the TUC horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out . But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low . There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show . But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning . Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference . It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key . But this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion . The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler . And the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same . This is drama enough . Do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade ? ? In the thirties we would not face our enemy ; ; that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element . Now we have stood up to the Communists ; ; we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights . Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? ? It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now . He writes , `` Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime '' . Whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic . Dulles ? ? He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man . McCarthy ? ? The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath . Suez ? ? Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye . Stalin's death , Churchill's farewell to public life , Hillary and Tensing on Everest , Quemoy and Matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade . Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles . Their Eisenhower is insubstantial . Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ? ? He often drew the bomb . He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines . And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all . But , but and but . Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale . Read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas . A gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community . The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat . But like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won't follow -- such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon ; ; Judge Black , the vegetarian black snake ; ; and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces . As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city . ( The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others . ) They train the mink and other animals to fight . And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won't have anyone around that's against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds . Robert Hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series . He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes . But it's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables . In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris ( Uncle Remus ) and the polished , witty fables of James Thurber . George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years . It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work : Scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues . In short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University , is both reliable and readable ; ; the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time . If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging . Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken . But he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February , 1945 . After all , Alger Hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents , was at Yalta . And Harry Dexter White , implicated in F.B.I. reports in Communist associations , was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed Germany to Stalin . One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength . It is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender '' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism . Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way : dashed hope `` You see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender : The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future '' . Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944 . A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language , history and literature , Kennan recalls how , at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a State Department official , expressing the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries '' . The hope was vain . With justified bitterness the author speaks of `` what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States '' . He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's `` puerile '' assumption that `` if only he ( Stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R. himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged '' . No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days '' of Roosevelt . This fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 , and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution . The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March , 1917 ; ; the second , the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks ( who later called themselves Communists ) in November of the same year . As Kennan shows , the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany . They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting . They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue . This , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of Allied intervention . As the author very justly says : `` Had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an Allied intervention in North Russia '' . The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ; ; here Kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking . Plebian dictators Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected . On Stalin : `` This was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits ; ; a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity ; ; a man in whose entourage none was ever safe ; ; a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ; ; a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime . '' And here is Kennan's image of Hitler , Stalin's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy : `` Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities : Shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess : The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word '' . Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan . And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time : How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war . But one should not ask for everything . Mr. Kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future . The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator . The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm . In `` Donnybrook '' , there is quite a different Eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing . There is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed . By and large , Robert McEnroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film , `` The Quiet Man '' , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one . This is the tale of one John Enright , an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man . But Innesfree , where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother , Will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists . So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told . You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means . Then there is a matchmaker , one Mikeen Flynn , a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected . Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play . Mr. Foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect . His matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony . Art Lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates Enright . Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway . Joan Fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays Ellen , and sings the role very well , too . If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind ; ; she fits into the general scheme well enough . Susan Johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one . She has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening . Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining . And in the role of Will Danaher , Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army , if he chose . `` Donnybrook '' is no `` Brigadoon '' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing . The ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent . It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy `` Sez I '' , does . `` A Toast To The Bride '' , sung by Clarence Nordstrom , playing a character called Old Man Toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching . The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine . So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction . The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating . Rouben Ter-Arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow . There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` Donnybrook '' , unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish . We can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show , `` Fanny '' , into a delightful and heart-warming film . The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed . More than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star , the great Raimu , were looking askance at the project . The fans of the musical were , too . But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday . Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart . Some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow . A tiny handful never did make the concert . But , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon's proceedings . They faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon . It was an excellent concert . Paul Paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the Philharmonic plays for him . Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding . It was not a heavy , ponderous Beethoven . The music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced . The Franck symphonic poem , `` Psyche '' , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again . Fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor ; ; if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying . Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score . He did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical . His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy . And in the Prokofieff C major Piano Concerto , with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner . Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive . He swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner . An impressive technician , Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot . His tone is the weakest part of his equipment ; ; it tends to be hard and colorless . A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs . It is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement ) ; ; and the composer himself was called the `` age of steel pianist '' . But granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied . Taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra . Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received . A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's `` Festival Overture '' , receiving its first New York hearing . This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry . It is not program music , though . It runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless . `` La Gioconda '' , like it or not , is a singer's opera . And so , of course , it is a fan's opera as well . Snow or no , the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work . So the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing . After all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts . One of those parts is that of evil , evil Barnaba , the spy . His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company . He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone . What was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character . Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season ; ; they have both sung these parts here before . Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion . Mr. Siepi was , as always , a consummate actor ; ; with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently . Part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords . His singing was strong and musical ; ; unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality . Eileen Farrell in the title role , Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance . If only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more . `` Melodious birds sing madrigals '' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined . Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces ( BG 609 ; ; stereo BGS 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of English madrigal singing . It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French `` chansons '' . The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else . The original impulses came to England late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like . Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished . The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal . Early interest Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries . As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal . Naturally , Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen : William Byrd , Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins . There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture . Both techniques give the music purity and clarity . Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle ( the French equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus . Only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio , Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial . Nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period . The works are presented chronologically . Texts and translations are provided . Elegance and color The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics . Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract . In France , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor . Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music '' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance . Both composers turn up on new imports from France . BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique . They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention . Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks ( LD056 and LD060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike . The Concerts -- nos. 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense . The sonatas , `` La Francaise '' , `` La Sultane '' , `` L'Astree '' and `` L'Imperiale '' , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong Italian influence . Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise Du 18e Siecle ( BAM LD 060 ) . Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit , but Bodin De Beismortier , Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words . What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo . The Couperin `` La Steinkerque '' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era . If Couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more . All these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic . Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor , recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet ( BAM LD 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself . The strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious . Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel , Buxtehude , Rosenmueller and Telemann , well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket ( BAM LD 035 ) . Rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts . Works by J. C. Bach , Anton Craft , Joseph Haydn , Giuseppe Sammartini , Comenico Dragonetti and J. G. Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff , flutist , Josef Marx , oboist , and Robert Conant , pianist and harpsichordist . Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez . Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night . Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome . The performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying . Ellie Mao , soprano , and Frederick Fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` East Meets West '' in Carnegie Recital Hall last night . They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee , pianist . Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages . Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao , who is a native of China , and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller , who is English by birth . This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles . On the contrary , Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn , Dvorak , Canteloube , Copland and Britten . There was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise . The performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal . What was omitted from `` A Neglected Education '' were those essentials known as `` the facts of life '' . Chabrier's little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very French , not without wit and charm . The poor uneducated newlywed , a certain Gontran De Boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information . The humor of the situation can be imagined . It all takes place in the eighteenth century . What a silly , artificial way of life , Chabrier and his librettists chuckle . But they wish they could bring it back . Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism . The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish . The simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes . Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran . Yes , Arlene is her name ; ; the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano . Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring . The work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music . It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera , `` The Poor Sailor '' , set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau , a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife . With the exception of a few spots , Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration . Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon . Sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5,500 other people . I make this observation about the lady , Miss Judy Garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day : `` Judy Garland has arrived in London . She's not chubby . She's not plump . She's fat '' . But who cares , when the lady sings ? ? Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet . They applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord . And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings . Things like `` When You're Smiling '' , `` Almost Like Being In Love '' , `` Do It Again '' , `` Born To Wander '' , `` Alone Together '' , `` Who Cares ? ? '' , `` Puttin' On The Ritz '' , `` How Long Has This Been Going On ? ? '' And her own personal songs like `` The Man That Got Away '' , and the inevitable `` Over The Rainbow '' . Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen . At the start of her program there were evidences of pique . She had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m. , the appointed hour , although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 . Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs . Along about 4:30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , Judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind . Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing . In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range . There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` Do It Again '' , and she made the tart observation that `` I never saw so much moving about in an audience '' . But it didn't take Judy Garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it . Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere . And time after time she really belted out her songs . Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way I felt about her `` Come Rain or Come Shine '' -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` Beautiful Weather '' . To her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise ; ; they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough . They were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing . Her `` Rockabye Your Baby '' was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like `` The Man That Got Away '' were deeply moving . The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard `` Over The Rainbow '' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` Get Happy '' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway . She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers . All went home happy except the Newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar . In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies . This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm . Several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap . Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations . But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of `` Django's Castle '' . For subtle swinging rhythms , I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of `` Weep '' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 Carrots For Robert '' , a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges . There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group . Unfortunately , Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein . He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like . What we did get , however , was impressive . A few drops of rain just before midnight , when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn't care whether they got wet . Miss Vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine . After the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever . Jazz Three open program The evening program was opened by the Jazz Three , a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass , Jack Warner , drums , and Don Cook , piano . This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group , also local talent , went on first . Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose : it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux ; ; it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience . The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James , the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program . Julie Wilson sings Julie Wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as `` Hard-Hearted Hannah , The Vamp Of Savannah '' , and the delightful `` Sunday '' . She frosted the cake with the always reliable `` Bill Bailey '' . From this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for `` Baubles , Bangles And Beads '' , and a couple of ballards . Getz is a difficult musician to categorize . He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over . In this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be . Shearing takes over George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer . He met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo . Shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances . A very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach . Divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` The Evolution Of The Blues '' , narrated by Jon Hendricks , who had presented it last year at the Monterey , Calif. , Jazz Festival , and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band . Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him . Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches . Surprise addition To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` Big '' Miller , as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean , Gospel-singer , while Oscar Brown Jr. , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer's call , a field-hands' work song , and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby , `` Brown Baby '' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival . One of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones , drumming to `` Old Man River '' , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts . Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest . He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts . Hendricks had Billy Mitchell , tenor sax ; ; Pony Poindexter , alto sax ; ; Jimmy Witherspoon , Blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the Ike Isaacs Trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples . It all went very well . Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas . Music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for RCA by Emil Gilels . He has chosen Sonata Op. 53 in Aj . The playing takes both sides of the disc . Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length . Rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the Gilels playing . His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully . The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style . The group is superbly trained . What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question . Do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the French word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ? ? I say chantey . Either way , the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening . If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one . The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international . Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` Signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` Journal '' . `` Signal '' is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais . Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg . Program note reads as follows : `` Take hands ; ; this urgent visage beckons us '' . Here , as in `` Journal '' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . Indeed , both `` Journal '' and `` Signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics . But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing . One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development . It may be , of course , that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation . But it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time . One thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be . ' an American journey ' A brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled `` An American Journey '' was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company . Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' `` Once Upon A Time '' as well as her `` Women's Song '' and Mr. Nagrin's `` Indeterminate Figure '' . Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for `` An American Journey '' , and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes . Mr. Nagrin has described four `` places '' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions '' , and concluded with `` A Toccata for the Young '' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing . The `` places '' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody's , and the laugh is on us all . But we need not mind too much , because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way . Miss Tamiris' `` Once Upon A Time '' is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures '' that bother them somehow . Unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so . Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time . The music here , Russell Smith's `` Tetrameron '' , sounded good . All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape . The Symphony Of The Air , greatly assisted by Van Cliburn , last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start . At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities . This news , announced by Jerome Toobin , the orchestra's administrative director , brought applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall . They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic , the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony . This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains . The details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , Mr. Toobin said . The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky , the Rachmaninoff Third , and the Prokofieff Third . It was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else : a concerto he has recently recorded , `` The Emperor '' . The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him . But they were not what distinguished his performance . The elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo . Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne . Alfred Wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery . The collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too . Mr. Wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the `` Leonore '' Overture No. 3 and the Fourth Symphony . The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively . And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven . Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4 . There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in . Today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it . In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit . Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' `` The Man I Love '' . Deemed too static when it was first heard in `` Lady Be Good '' in Philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score . It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` Strike Up The Band '' and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up . It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of `` Strike Up The Band '' in 1929 . ( Still another song in `` Strike Up The Band '' -- `` I've Got A Crush On You '' -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , `` Treasure Girl '' . ) second chance Like the Gershwins , Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them . If one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure , Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show . Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney , along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , Rodgers And Hart Revisited ( Spruce Records , 505 Fifth Avenue , New York ) . Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of `` The Garrick Gaieties '' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed ; ; Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions `` At The Roxy Music Hall '' from `` I Married An Angel '' ; ; and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of `` I Blush '' , a song that was cut from `` A Connecticut Yankee '' . Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists . Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment . Turning to the current musical season on Broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( R. C. A. Victor LOC 1066 ; ; stereo LSO 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect . Robert Morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score . Rudy Vallee , who shares star billing with Mr. Morse , makes only two appearances . He shares with Mr. Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice . In general , Mr. Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer . Like Mr. Loesser , Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey ( R. C. A. Victor LOC 1065 ; ; stereo LSO 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics . For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel , Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles . Resourceful voices There are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of Robert Weede , Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of Molly Picon . Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms . Not content to create only the music and lyrics , Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away ( Capitol WAO 1643 ; ; stereo SWAO 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works . The melodies flow along pleasantly , as Mr. Coward's songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality . Elaine Stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward's songs . With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 , -- `` The House I Live In '' , `` The Cranes Are Flying '' and `` Ballad Of A Soldier '' -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in `` The Day The War Ended '' . It simply isn't , not by a long shot . The Artkino presentation , with English titles , opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre . Make no mistake , this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed . In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments . Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict's aftermath . Unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else . Tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't want to hurt . It's the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's `` Titanic '' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante . Not that the picture is superficial . Under Yakov Segal's direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture . One high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the Germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons . Ring Of Bright Water , by Gavin Maxwell . 211 pages . Dutton . A5 . Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience . `` Ring Of Bright Water '' by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands . `` He has married me with a ring of bright water '' , begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys . The place is Camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye . It is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , Greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters . How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience . Just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough . But it isn't . There is Mijbil , an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat . It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature . This is not only a compliment to Mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to Camusfearna , with affectionate detail . Mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits . He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth . He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow . Systematically he would open and ransack drawers . Given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours . With curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so . A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well . In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness . `` To be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating ; ; it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses '' . Now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature . Two other people in time shared Mijbil's love : `` it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water ; ; we were his Trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation . In turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship '' . Yet the idyll ended . The brief details of Mijbil's death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy . Man , to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man . But then , through a strange coincidence , Maxwell manages to acquire Idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more . One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- Mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or Maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed . This reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement . Now Gavin Maxwell's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world . New York -- The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater . They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century . On the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie . Of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism . The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance . But they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic . In France , novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted . The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results . So far as I know , the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters . Last season , the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's `` Phedre '' and Moliere's `` School For Wives '' . The new `` Phedre '' was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient Greek ; ; perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time . The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance . A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent . The new `` School For Wives '' was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character . Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago , Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while Fernand Ledoux , often performing at the Comedie , made them more gross than Moliere may have intended . Apparently , Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in `` The School For Wives '' . I say `` apparently '' although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death ; ; by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy . Arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be . The part can lend itself to serious treatment ; ; one influential French critic remarked : `` Pity for Arnolphe comes with age '' . Accordingly , at the Comedie last year , Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy . But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly . Wisely , the Comedie has brought Moliere's `` Tartuffe '' on its tour and has left `` The School For Wives '' at home . Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife . Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and Ledoux , at the Comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us . Louis Seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux , is the Tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed . His Tartuffe observes the golden mean . His red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality . But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory ; ; of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation . Occasionally , Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another . The whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts . His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly . Here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness . Seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service . In that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie . We are often told that the Comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage . Seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ; ; among his other parts are the leads in `` The Bourgeois Gentleman '' and `` The Imaginary Invalid '' . In Moliere's farce , `` The Tricks Of Scapin '' , Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles . Here some innovation is attempted . To begin with , Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master . Hirsch's Scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves . Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world . And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant . Django Reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels . There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn't owe something to Django . And Django owed much to Louis Armstrong . He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris . It was the first jazz he had heard . Django , who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France , was an extraordinary man . Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette . And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz . You can catch up with him -- if you haven't already -- on RCA-Victor's album . `` Djangology '' , made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France . This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too , of course . He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin . They play : `` Minor Swing '' , `` Honeysuckle Rose '' , `` Beyond The Sea '' , `` Bricktop '' , `` Heavy Artillery '' , `` Djangology '' , `` After You've Gone '' , `` Where Are You , My Love '' ? ? `` I Saw Stars '' , `` Lover Man '' , `` Menilmontant '' and `` Swing 42 '' . All this is great proceedings -- get the minutes . Kid Ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz . He dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans . His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember . Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made . He is starred against Alvin Alcorn , trumpet ; ; Phil Gomez , clarinet ; ; Cedric Haywood , piano ; ; Julian Davidson , guitar ; ; Wellman Braud , bass , and Minor Hall , drums . The set contains `` High Society '' , `` Do What Ory Say '' , `` Down Home Rag '' , `` Careless Love '' , Jazz Me Blues '' , `` Weary Blues '' , `` Original Dixieland One-Step '' , `` Bourbon Street Parade '' , `` Panama '' , `` Toot , Toot , Tootsie '' , `` Oh Didn't He Ramble '' , `` Beale Street Blues '' , `` Maryland , My Maryland '' , `` 1919 Rag '' , `` Eh , La Bas '' , `` Mood Indigo '' , and `` Bugle Call Rag '' . All this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems . Mischa Elman shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers . His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky . That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ; ; Mr. Elman is 70 years old . There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman . But , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical . The occasion was sentimental ; ; so was the playing . The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston's Dance Overture , William Schuman's `` Chester '' From `` New England Triptych '' and two works of Wallingford Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op. 58 , and a Romanza For Strings , Op. 56A . The Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew . The Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ; ; like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his `` Non-Dissonant ( Mostly ) '' category of works . The Schuman `` Chester '' takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect . All these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors . It was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change . We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony . A woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of `` A Question Of Adultery '' , yesterday's new British import at the Apollo . Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film's extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous . In its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath . With Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive . The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident . Anthony Steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous . The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey , as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander . After a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one's surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved . When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place . So was the audience . London , July 4 -- For its final change of bill in its London season , the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program '' at the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden . No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased . And please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences . At the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it . Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` Taras Bulba '' , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all . Only a plea from the house manager , John Collins , finally broke up the party . But for all the manifest intention to `` show off '' , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company . The `` Taras Bulba '' excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi . It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform . Yuri Soloviev , Oleg Sokolov , Alexei Zhitkov , Lev Sokolov , Yuri Korneyev and Mr. Livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent . At the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet `` Bayaderka '' , which opened the evening . What a man this Petipa was ! ! And why do we in the West know so few of his ballets ? ? This scene is a `` white ballet '' in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows '' who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting . The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece . Its ballerina , Olga Moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and Ludmilla Alexeyeva , Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments . Sergei Vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies . The middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that . They consisted of a new arrangement of `` Nutcracker '' excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev , with a large ensemble ; ; a winning little `` Snow Maiden '' variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva ; ; two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other ; ; an amusing character pas de cinq called `` Gossiping Women '' ; ; a stirring `` Flames Of Paris '' pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky , and a lovely version of Fokine's `` Le Cygne '' by Olga Moiseyeva , which had to be repeated . Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor . It was quite an evening ! ! A year ago today , when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency , Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960 . As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated , Mr. White took more notes . He traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon . He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates' `` in-groups '' . He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history . Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election ; ; how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in `` The Making Of The President 1960 '' . This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one . What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history . Mr. White , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter . His zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book . A lesson in politics As a dramatic narrative `` The Making Of The President 1960 '' is continuously engrossing . And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational . The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr. Kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns . He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls : five Democrats -- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey , Senator Stuart Symington , Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy -- and two Republicans -- Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon . Then , in chronological order , Mr. White covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself . In the process he writes at length about many related matters : the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television . Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions . He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth , from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself ; ; but never from Mr. Nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust . `` Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less '' , says Mr. White . Mr. Nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign . Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , Mr. Nixon , Mr. White believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television . Mr. Nixon is `` a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection ; ; he trusts only himself and his wife . He is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses . He was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked . He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them ; ; the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon '' . Mr. Kennedy , Mr. White believes , `` had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him '' . Calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent '' , Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about everybody . He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers . Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds . Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance . Mr. Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters . Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President . Pressures portrayed Throughout `` The Making Of A President '' Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles . And he makes many interesting comments . Here are several : `` The root question in American politics is always : Who's the Man to See ? ? To understand American politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not . But to operate in American politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection '' . `` In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion '' . `` All platforms are meaningless : the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it '' . Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night , continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts . Miss Pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments . The better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing . No orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night . In all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism . One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's `` Shadow Song '' . The years suddenly fell away at this point . On the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on . Sharing the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard Verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion . Mr. Verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume . Later on this problem vanished , and the `` Flower Song '' from Bizet's `` Carmen '' was beautifully and intelligently projected . Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener . Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible . The mushrooming of FM outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity . Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which , in the United States , comprises some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year . Of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching . He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials . But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects . It is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3,400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro . At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states . These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and TV advertisers . For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio . In the past 10 years , Sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent : Negro population in the U.S. has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent . `` The forgotten 15 million '' -- as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million . Advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it . Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels . Futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air . In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by Sponsor . A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business . The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth . It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed : that more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states . Also , the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York -- not in the South at all . In New York City , WLIB boasts `` more community service programs than any other Negro station '' and `` one of the largest Negro news staffs in America '' . And WWRL's colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests . Recently , WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit . A half-dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade . In all big cities outside the South , and even in small towns within the South , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners . The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total U.S. Negro population . One question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status . Whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal . Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests . And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet . What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? ? Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers ; ; rhythm-and-blues mood music ; ; `` race '' music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs . Furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station . Advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern . Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race ; ; he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous '' . The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of KSAN , San Francisco : `` Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires . It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life . Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation '' . Presentation of `` The Life And Times Of John Sloan '' in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art . Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow , Helen Farr Sloan , to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts , the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work . From early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate . Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived . Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness . The paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of America in the first half of the present century . Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri . As early as 1928 , however , the Sloan style began to change . The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette . The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes . The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided art . In addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations . Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York , thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs . One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is `` Sun And Wind On The Roof '' , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds . Although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of `` Gloucester Harbor '' in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan's art . Significant are such canvases as `` Bleeker Street , Saturday Night '' , with its typically American crowd ( Sloan never went abroad ) ; ; the multifigure `` Traveling Carnival '' , in which action is vivified by lighting ; ; or `` Carmine Theater , 1912 '' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although Sloan was a member of the famous `` Eight '' , and of the so-called `` Ash-Can School '' , a term he resented . Not all the paintings , however , are of cities . The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest ( `` Koshare in the Dust '' , a vigorous Indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) . The fact that Sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle . There are 151 items in the Wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the `` Eight '' , as well as work by Sloan's friends and students . Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist's library , etc. . All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League , New York , in the 1920's . To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries , the Delaware Art Center ( according to its director , Bruce St. John ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works , as well as a card index file . The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians . The current exhibition , which remains on view through Oct. 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources . Any musician playing Beethoven here , where Beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care . In a sense , he is offering Bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer's mature style . Robert Riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style . His readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous . The 32 C Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline . The D Minor Sonata , Op. 31 No. 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come . These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of `` opera style '' of which Beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging . Two late Sonatas , Op. 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the Op. 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious . The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op. 126 . Herr Riefling , in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority . Volker Wangenheim , who conducted Bonn's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation . Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city's music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium . But he weighted the Eighth Symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music . He might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the Ninth ; ; but no amount of head-tossing could make it so . The conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring . The concerto's soloist , Hans Richter-Haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling . His was a burgomaster's Beethoven , solid and sensible . Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano , Chorus , And Orchestra In C Minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs . The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein ( Bonn's civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life . The last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis . A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise . This theory eventually proved inexact . But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors . These keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge . In the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator . The participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King's College , London ; ; Dr. W. B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ; ; Dr. R. A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; ; and Dr. G. J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London . Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator . The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , `` Rival Theories Of Cosmology '' . Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity . First of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds . Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there . This expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years . Expands and contracts Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in . Then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again . Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory . He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space . For this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions . New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies . If this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding . For new galaxies to be created , Professor Bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years . He contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments . Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons . Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter . The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure . Suppose , says Dr. Lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) . This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess . Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere . Because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere . Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it . This , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe . Fleeting glimpse This slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has . Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field . It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science . Presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation . These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories . There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions . In doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos . And although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man . `` Roots '' , the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl . Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York , most of `` Roots '' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy . Only in its final scene , where Beatie Bryant ( Mary Doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts . The burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in England ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine . Rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought . They care no more for politics , says Mr. Wesker , than they do for a symphony . Seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life . They dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived . But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it . So much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) . The messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy . Now for the good points . Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile . She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good British socialism . But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal . Beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom . Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by `` Roots '' . There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else . But I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences . Shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's `` Much Ado About Nothing '' opening the season of free theatre in Central Park . The New York Shakespeare Festival , which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed , began bravely . Joseph Papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` Much Ado '' , had a vibrant , colorful production under way . Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture . The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence . The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles . The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads , evoked laughter . The vivacity of the masquers' party at Leonato's palace , with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon , cast a spell of delight . As `` Much Ado '' turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall . At first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened . But the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart . The grieving Hero and her father , Leonato , followed by the Friar , left the stage . A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes . More than half the audience departed . Some remained in the Wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads . Others huddled under the trees outside the fence . Twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped . Beatrice ( Nan Martin ) and Benedick ( J. D. Cannon ) took their places on the stage . In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare , like a Nostradamus , had foreseen this moment . Said Benedick : `` Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while '' ? ? Replied Beatrice : `` Yea , and I will weep a while longer '' . The heavens refused to give up their weeping . The gallant company completed Act 4 , and got through part of Act 5 . But the final scenes could not be played . If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort . `` Much Ado '' ends happily . The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare . One could hardly blame Newbold Morris , the Parks Commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains . Eldon Elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood . Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable . Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints . Still a demurrer or two must be entered . Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf . For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her . If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible . Put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision . But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism . Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside . The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable . Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic . There was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect . The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness . There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication . Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition . All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ; Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them . The dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8,500 of them ) had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs . On Saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved . There was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons . Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's `` Roots Of The Blues '' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival . Otherwise , the program included , as on Thursday , the Taras-Tchaikovsky `` Design For Strings '' , the Dollar-Britten `` Divertimento '' , the Dollar-De Banfield `` The Duel '' and the pas de deux from `` The Nutcracker '' . Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn , who danced the `` Nutcracker '' pas de deux , were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from `` Don Quixote '' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely . Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` The Duel '' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants . Mr. Ailey's `` Roots Of The Blues '' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening . As Brother John Sellers sang five `` blues '' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard , Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic . Their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan . He wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress . The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions . `` Roots Of The Blues '' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact . `` Perhaps it is better to stay at home . The armchair traveler preserves his illusions '' . This somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' , a collection of travel essays by William Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long . Mr. Sansom is English , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between . The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell , Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ) . The result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices . There are sixteen essays in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' . Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines . All are well written and are overwritten . But , even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound . Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another . Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references . A contemplative connoisseur `` I like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life '' . This is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does . He ignores guidebook facts . He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions . It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past . William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London , Vienna , the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords . But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions . `` A writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment '' , he says . `` Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all . To transmit that feeling he writes '' . This may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom . So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; ; at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City ; ; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants , La Bonne Auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ; ; and at the infinite variety of London . Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto . He can coin a neat phrase : `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people '' ; ; tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears '' ; ; after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity '' . And , for all his lacquered , almost Byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison . Beauty borrowed from afar In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza . How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus : `` The white colonnaded , cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South , the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza : the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips '' . Nice , even if a trifle gaudy . `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs . In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio . WBAI , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void . Yesterday it offered `` Poised For Violence '' , by Jean Reavey . WBAI is on the right track : in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate . Unfortunately , `` Poised For Violence '' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point . Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged . The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves . In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty . Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit . But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt . Moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills . But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words . Which in itself is an immediate reward of the WBAI experiment ; ; good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration . A weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month . Titled `` What's New In Music '' ? ? The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station Aj . The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze . The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor , Chuck Briefer . The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings . Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch , Karlheinz Stockhausen , Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space '' opera by the Swedish composer , Karl-Birger Blomdahl . Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country . It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene . But one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions . The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close . It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart . It is good to see those numbers again . The `` Suite Of Old Russian Dances '' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth ; ; the amusing `` Yurochka '' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance ; ; the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` Polyanka '' or `` The Meadow '' ; ; the three Moldavian dances entitled `` Zhok '' ; ; the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` Bul'ba '' ; ; and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` City Quadrille '' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back . So , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` Kalmuk Dance '' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called `` The Platter '' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` Summer '' , `` The Three Shepherds '' of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` Rock 'n' Roll '' . As autumn starts its annual sweep , few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring . Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth . The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles , western Europe , eastern China , southern Chile and parts of Japan , New Zealand and Tasmania . Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in North America . Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle ; ; in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze . The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights . Foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year . Below is a specific guide , keyed to the calendar . Nature Canada . Late September finds Quebec's color at its peak , especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St. Lawrence River . In the Maritime provinces farther east , the tones are a little quieter . Ontario's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 , with both Muskoka ( 100 miles north of Toronto ) and Haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of Toronto ) holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23 . In the Canadian Rockies , great groves of aspen are already glinting gold . New England . Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15 , and often hit a height in early October . New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches . The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine . In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut , the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October . Middle Atlantic states . The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October , choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area . Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid-October , notably along routes 23 and 23A . About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania are magnificent -- Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct. 14 , 15 . New Jersey's color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May . Southeast . During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia . The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee . Midwest . Michigan , Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October , especially in their northern sections , e.g. , Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29-Oct. 8 . In Wisconsin , take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie Du Chien . In Michigan , there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits , while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular . In Minnesota , Arrowhead County and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding . Farther south , there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks , with some seasonal peaks as late as early November . Illinois' Shawnee National Forest , Missouri's Iron County and the maples of Hiawatha , Kan. should be at their best in mid-October . The West . The Rockies have many `` Aspencades '' , which are organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing the golden panoramas . In Colorado , Ouray has its Fall Color Week Sept. 22-29 , Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept. 24 , and Steamboat Springs has a week-long Aspencade Sept. 25-30 . New Mexico's biggest is at Ruidoso Oct. 7 , 8 , while Alamogordo and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct. 1 . Americana pleasure domes . Two sharply contrasting places designed for public enjoyment are now on display . The Corn Palace at Mitchell , S. Dak. , `` the world's corniest building '' , has a carnival through Sept. 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt . Since 1892 ears of red , yellow , purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create huge `` paintings '' . The 1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial , with the pictures including the Lewis and Clark expedition , the first river steamboat , the 1876 gold rush , a little red schoolhouse on the prairie , and today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs . The panels will stay up until they are replaced next summer . Longwood Gardens , near Kennett Square , Pa. ( about 12 miles from Wilmington , Del. ) , was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S. Du Pont . Every Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display , with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up to 130 feet . The `` peacock tail '' nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high . The gardens themselves are open free of charge the year round , and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor . The greenhouses alone cover 3-1/2 acres . Books clock without hands . Carson McCullers , after a long , painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul , has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication . Though the subject -- segregation in her native South -- has been thoroughly worked , Miss McCullers uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern American writing . Franny and Zooey . With an art that almost conceals art , J. D. Salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts . Here , in the most eagerly awaited novel of the season ( his first since The Catcher In The Rye , ) he tells of a college girl in flight from the life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her 25-year-old brother . The Head Of Monsieur M. , Althea Urn . A deft , hilarious satire on very high French society involving a statesman with two enviable possessions , a lovely young bride and a head containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove it for greater comfort . There is probably a moral in all this about `` mind vs. heart '' . A Matter Of Life And Death . Virgilia Peterson , a critic by trade , has turned her critical eye pitilessly and honestly on herself in an autobiography more of the mind and heart than of specific events . It is an engrossing commentary on a repressive , upper-middle-class New York way of life in the first part of this century . Dark Rider . This retelling by Louis Zara of the brief , anguished life of Stephen Crane -- poet and master novelist at 23 , dead at 28 -- is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic subject . Rural Free , Rachel Peden . Subtitled A Farmwife's Almanac Of Country Living , this is a gentle and nostalgic chronicle of the changing seasons seen through the clear , humorous eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist . Dance Russians , Filipinos . Two noted troupes from overseas will get the fall dance season off to a sparkling start . Leningrad's Kirov Ballet , famous for classic purity of technique , begins its first U.S. tour in New York ( through Sept. 30 ) . The Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company , with music and dances that depict the many facets of Filipino culture , opens its 60-city U.S. tour in San Francisco ( through Sept. 24 ) then , via one-night stands , moves on to Los Angeles ( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1 ) . Festivals across the land . With harvests in full swing , you can enjoy festivals for grapes at Sonoma , Calif. ( Sept. 22-24 ) , as well as for cranberries at Bandon , Ore. ( Sept. 28 thru Oct. 1 ) , for buckwheat at Kingwood , W. Va. ( Sept. 28-30 ) , sugar cane at New Iberia , La. ( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1 ) and tobacco at Richmond , Va. ( Sept. 23-30 ) . The mule is honored at Benson , N.C. ( Sept. 22 , 23 ) and at Boron , Calif. ( Sept. 24 thru Oct. 1 ) , while the legend of the Maid of the Mist is celebrated at Niagara Falls through the 24th . The fine old mansions of U.S. Grant's old home town of Galena , Ill. are open for inspection ( Sept. 23 , 24 ) . An archery tournament will be held at North Falmouth , Mass. ( Sept. 23 , 24 ) . The 300th anniversaries of Staten Island ( through Sept. 23 ) and of Mamaroneck , N.Y. ( through Sept. 24 ) will both include parades and pageants . Movies Purple Noon : This French film , set in Italy , is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny scenery -- so breath-taking that at times you almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with . But slowly they take over as Alain Delon ( Life , Sept. 15 ) , playing a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy , casually tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going to murder him , then does it even while the American is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit from the act . Records Norma . Callas devotees will have good reason to do their customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo version of the Bellini opera . Maria goes all out as a Druid princess who gets two-timed by a Roman big shot . By turns , her beautifully sung Norma is fierce , tender , venomous and pitiful . The tenor lead , Franco Corelli , and La Scala cast under Maestro Tullio Serafin are all first rate . Jeremiah Peabody's polyunsaturated quick dissolving fast acting pleasant tasting green and purple pills . In a raucous take-off on radio commercials , Singer Ray Stevens hawks a cure-all for neuritis , neuralgia , head-cold distress , beriberi , overweight , fungus , mungus and water on the knee . Of the nation's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below America's belt line . Waterways are busy right now from the Virginia capes to the Texas coast . There true yachtsmen often find November winds steadier , the waters cooler , the fish hungrier , and rivers more pleasant -- less turbulence and mud , and fewer floating logs . More and more boats move overland on wheels ( 1.8 million trailers are now in use ) and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their craft . In the Southwest , the fall brings out flotillas of boatsmen who find the summer too hot for comfort . And on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens of frostbite races . Some pleasant fall cruising country is mapped out below . Boating west coast . Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water -- ocean , lake and reservoir . Shore facilities are enormous -- Los Angeles harbors 5,000 boats , and Long Beach 3,000 -- but marinas are crowded everywhere . New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa Del Rey , Ventura , Dana Point , Oceanside and Mission Bay . Inland , outboard motorists welcome cooler weather and the chance to buzz over Colorado River sandbars and Lake Mead . Newest small-boat playground is the Salton Sea , a once-dry desert sinkhole which is now a salty lake 42 miles long and 235 feet below sea level . On Nov. 11 , 12 , racers will drive their flying shingles in 5-mile laps over its 500-mile speedboat course . In San Francisco Bay , winds are gusty and undependable during this season . A sailboat may have a bone in her teeth one minute and lie becalmed the next . But regattas are scheduled right up to Christmas . The Corinthian Yacht Club in Tiburon launches its winter races Nov. 5 . Gulf Coast . Hurricane Carla damaged 70% of the marinas in the Galveston-Port Aransas area but fuel service is back to normal , and explorers can roam as far west as Port Isabel on the Mexican border . Sailing activity is slowed down by Texas northers , but power cruisers can move freely , poking into the San Jacinto , Trinity and Brazos rivers ( fine tarpon fishing in the Brazos ) or pushing eastward to the pirate country of Barataria . Off Grand Isle , yachters often visit the towering oil rigs . The Mississippi Sound leads into a protected waterway running about 200 miles from Pascagoula to Apalachicola . Lower Mississippi . Memphis stinkpotters like McKellar Lake , inside the city limits , and sailors look for autumn winds at Arkabutla Lake where fall racing is now in progress . River cruising for small craft is ideal in November . At New Orleans , 25-mile-square Lake Pontchartrain has few squalls and year-long boating . Marinas are less plush than the Florida type but service is good and Creole cooking better . tva lakes . Ten thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the 30-odd lakes in the vast Tennessee River system that loops in and out of seven states . When dam construction began in 1933 , fewer than 600 boats used these waters ; ; today there are 48,500 . A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 . If this was in fact Mr. Remarque's intention he has achieved a notable failure . Clerfayt of `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one . He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; ; the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate . One looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised . Unhappily , `` Heaven Has No Favorites '' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list . Mr. Remarque's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble . He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery . His treatment of it is something else . His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay . Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen . Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing . The ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing ; ; the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming ; ; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality . This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer . Hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant . Race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes . He does not . The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature . Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal . The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing . The necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls `` Giuseppe '' , parked `` on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him '' is not a liberty ; ; it is an absurdity . But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that Remarque's failure is plainest . Clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive . To be human , he believes , is to seek one's own destruction : the Freudian `` death-wish '' cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers . In point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live . A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit ; ; a Portago could say , as he did say to me , `` If I die tomorrow , still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years ; ; but I shan't die tomorrow ; ; I'll live to be 105 '' . Clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood '' . The Italian master Piero Taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae . Clerfayt , driving , sees himself `` a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell '' ; ; the Briton Stirling Moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet . Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us . However , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists . The west is leaderless , according to this book . In contrast , the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev , Tito , and Mao . Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all . It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity ; ; about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy . But these Western countries do care about themselves . Each feels intensely national . If , say , the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub , then Tom Jones would fight the Commies . But he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as `` cause '' . For all practical purposes , the West stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership . With this barrage , Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West . Never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America . At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state . With Britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States . Montgomery believes that she started well . `` America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike '' . She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace . America has divided more than she has united the West . The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked . However , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed . But the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor . `` They are determined '' , Montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible '' . The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad . To `` Monty '' , the American people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War '' . As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead . The path to leadership is made clear . Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order . Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence . This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States , namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany , that the East German government does not exist , that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired , that the true government of China is in Formosa , that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960 , and that either China or Russia wants or expects war . Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked . After drastically overhauling NATO , Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West . Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 . `` The West should make the central proposal ; ; but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out '' . `` But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us '' ? ? Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy . The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle . He alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision . But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul . Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership . The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper . All in all , Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him . In looking as far back as Moses , thence to Cromwell , Napoleon , Lincoln , Churchill , and Nehru , Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men . He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war . However , Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice . Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene . Like Eisenhower , he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians . However , at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions . `` Monty '' shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support . For the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts . Nevertheless , Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world . It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership . And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events . It is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live '' for the first time only after he has died . But then , Mario Lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital '' only when he has ceased to be a living voice . It is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( RCA Victor LM 2454 , $4.98 ) . To be sure , Lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk . The reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public . The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person , which , allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day . That mother hen of the weight-height tables , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. , clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight . Through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough . Now big forces buffet food . For the first time in history , the U.S. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce . In this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume . Refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage . And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health . To eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine . Fads , facts Not all the concern for health is well directed . From the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the U.S. has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules . Each year , reports the American Medical Association , ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements . At juice bars in Los Angeles' 35 `` health '' stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz. glass . Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all . But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of U.S. scientists wants to supply them . The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime K ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well . From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene , under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis ( `` We get a rumble on every touchdown '' ) , blocky , grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious , $200,000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing . Pursuing it , he has logged 500,000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals , from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini . He has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of Neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal '' eaten by Capetown coloreds , and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen . And fats . Keys's findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche . Vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers' milk is still the ticket ) . Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack . Already many an American knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) . Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far : Americans eat too much . The typical U.S. daily menu , says Dr. Keys , contains 3,000 calories , should contain 2,300 . And extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack . Americans eat too much fat . With meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says Dr. Keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease . Obesity : a malnutrition . Throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life . The deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant . In West Africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` Red Johnny '' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease . In the well-fed U.S. , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years . Today , as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine , a standard internist's text , puts it , `` The most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity '' . Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin . Says Keys : `` Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think '' . Morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him . The simple mechanical strain of overweight , says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built '' . The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums . He has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer . He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes . He may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement . Physiologically , people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the `` appestat '' is set too high . The appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says Jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body's temperature , sleep and water-balance controls . Physical exercise raises the appestat . So does cold weather . In moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail ) ; ; but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz. -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry . In rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety . Food for frustration . Far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion . It may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging . Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment . The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' . Food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does . Reports Dr. Keys : `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more . He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys . So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake . It's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she's being deprived of something else '' . For the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won . Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( Benzedrine , Dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will '' . Keys has no such objections to Metrecal , Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters . `` Metrecal is a pretty complete food '' , he says . `` It contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals . In the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs. '' . But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food . That remarkable cholesterol . Despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting '' ) , Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat . What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer : coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents . Cholesterol , the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol . Scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the Greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight . They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones . They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system . But they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver . Although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body . `` A remarkable substance '' , says Dr. Keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries '' . When thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks . Explains Keys : As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery . The proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind . As cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation . Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens . A clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack . Or ( more commonly , thinks Keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs : the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured . Fats & coronaries . Ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile . Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says Dr. Keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood . But fatty foods do . During World War 2 , , doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact : despite the stresses of Nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping . Not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason . That year , Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods . That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise . Here Keys and others , such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each . All natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated . The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule . Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens . Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens . The three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz. ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol . In American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute '' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom . Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , `` I wish they were emeralds '' . Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on . The way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : Af Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness . Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental . And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture . In other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white . At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo . To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber . The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ; but communication , no . This basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith , Jr. , at the University of Buffalo , where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics . A brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named Arthur , who never could make up his mind '' . Later , he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute . It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' . To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education . It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people . This , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy . In the early 1950's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking '' with one's hands , et cetera . Smith's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone . For example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother . The usual U.S. norm would be : Af Middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end . The symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture U.S.A. . Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : Af Note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; ; this is a `` fade '' ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother . Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : Af In other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated . And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired . An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp . With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture . The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world . Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training . Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts . In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words . At a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists . Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level . By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist . Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms . It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences . Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist . His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people . The patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ; ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e. , she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before . Then she catapults into `` everything and everybody '' , putting particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point . Consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention . He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment . Immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , `` I don't feel like talking right now '' . Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refers to the woman's husband . She says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death '' . The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce . By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words . This the therapist may pursue in later questioning . The phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative '' . Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience . His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman . Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again . Yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him ; ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' . What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved . Some of the classic indicators , as described by Drs. Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in The First Five Minutes , are these : ambiguity of pronouns : Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty . On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person . The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; ; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives . When someone says , for example , `` They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me '' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made . ( This patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty . ) Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden , in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship . She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 . The John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city's new and modern harbor . Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole . If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . Which was poison gas . It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront . For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons . Throughout the early years of World War 2 , , reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas -- Germany in Russia , Japan in China again . They were always denied . Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns . Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first . To silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : `` From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . I have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons . `` However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . `` Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind . This country has not used them , and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them . I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' . The following month the invasion of Italy was begun , and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy . Bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields . Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne . It would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below . So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey . A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard , followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson , the Cargo Security Officer . Secrecy was paramount . Only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks . No one else must know . Thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari . It was the night of December 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in Bari . It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit . Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried . He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy . On November 24th , they had made a raid on La Maddalena . Two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the Me-210 had made its first appearance . After it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went to higher headquarters and said : `` For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures . They're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic '' . But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist . Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` Little Blitz '' on London in 1944 , a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously . True , there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast . No , Bari was out of range . More than that , Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector . So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him . For Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper . The Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available . There were no R.A.F. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield . The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable . Telephone communication was bad . And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command . It had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign Kay K. Vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the John Bascom . A British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped . Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers . `` This harbor is a bomber's paradise '' , the Britisher had said with frank grimness . `` It's up to you to protect yourselves . We can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either . They're all being used on offensive missions '' . Vesole had been stunned . Not fire until the bombs came down ! ! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head . Like hell ! ! Like hell he'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ? What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ? ? Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette . Below decks , Seaman 1/c Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home . Above decks on the John Harvey , Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy . There were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible . Bari was asking for it , he thought . For five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold . Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded . He hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth . The burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men . Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs . They seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari . Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already . Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave . Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade . The other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard . Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly . Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- Porto Vecchio . The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette . Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward . His eyes boggled . It was a clear night and it was raining ! ! Capt. Michael A. Musmanno , Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula , had also seen and felt the `` rain '' . But he had mistaken it for bugs . Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population . Musmanno was on deck . At exactly 7:30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face . He snatched at it savagely . He turned the beam of his flashlight on it . He laughed . It was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating . He frowned . But how could -- ? ? Another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth . It was two feet long . It was not candy wrapping . It was `` window '' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers . `` Fermate '' ! ! Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen . `` Stop ! ! Stop the engines '' ! ! Unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari . They had come from airports in the Balkans , these hundred-odd Junkers 88's . They had winged over the Adriatic , they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill . They had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares . And they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on . After the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's shot it out . In that interval , the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor . Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss . The little Unsinkable sank almost immediately . Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft . They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under . John Bascom went down early , too . Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets . Most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs . Vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire . He was wounded , but fought on . Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors . Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One , Three and Five . Now the Bascom was mortally wounded . Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt . The order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks . There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement . You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before . I can't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! ! This experience will have happened to many of you . Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences . In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually . When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar . Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude . One day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified . Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? ? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself . One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , `` I want a word with you , please '' . At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier . Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts . However , readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : : As `` a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams '' . Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities . I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town . I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen . And when psychology explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence . The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ? Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? ? Every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available . In most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects . But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life . For instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car . There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams . The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support . A `` mental image '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension . Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain . But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain . The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The Theory Of Representative Perception , in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says , `` passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception '' . But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location . Hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness . Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions . If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? ? It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future . Three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events . The body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies . The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions . When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep . If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life . Dr. H. V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification . As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day . Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest's information . Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream . He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English . We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning . But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ? Which theory is more fantastic : 1 . That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain , or 2 . That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ? ? The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling . No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind . Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake . When we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists . If deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people . Chauncey Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met . After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt . If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue . But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene . He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had . One week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore . `` The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here '' ! ! So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School , Lake Placid , New York . In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school . Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good . When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities . Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands . These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight . From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June . The Director , Walter E. Clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare . To him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind . Improved farming methods The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden . The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school . In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques . Where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail . Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat . Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil . `` To give up these notions required a revolution in thought '' , Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading `` Organic Gardening '' And `` Modern Nutrition '' in a search for help with his problems . `` Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist '' . By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray . He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains . After reading `` Plowman's Folly '' by Edward H. Faulkner , he stopped plowing . The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds . Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells . All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year . It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader . Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity . Soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this . To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth . Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , `` This soil used to be like that hard packed road over there '' . `` People and soils respond slowly '' , says Walter Clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program . No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used '' . The garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar . The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter ; ; the cabbage and squash keep until March or April . There is never enough corn , peas or strawberries . Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future . A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter . New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment . `` After the soil , the kitchen '' , says Mr. Clark . The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread . `` Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push '' . At first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves . `` You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread '' , was an early complaint . Of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better . Homemade bread Mrs. Clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering . Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager . Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread . Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour . Once the grains are ground , vitamin E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week . A mill stands in a room off the kitchen . Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state . Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor . She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding . The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma . It is well liked by the children and faculty . There is one problem with the bread . `` Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much '' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds . Hot , freshly-ground cereal The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served . When the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day . They serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal . Occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot '' . At the beginning of the school year , the new students don't eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously . When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal . The school has received letters from parents asking , `` What happened to Johnny ? ? He never used to like any hot cereal , now that's the only kind he wants . Where can we get this cereal he likes so much '' ? ? Body-building foods Salads are served at least once a day . Vegetables are served liberally . Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer . Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week . Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey . Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today '' ? ? Milk appears twice a day . The school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs . Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served . Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility . Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week . Also , salt water fish is on the table once a week . For deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week . Most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time . Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed . Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed . Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm . Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem . Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways . Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont . Wheat-germ , brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves . Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables . Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves . Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged . Drinking with meals is also discouraged ; ; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables . Nothing is peeled . The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues . The cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin C content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible . Wholesome snacks , no candy Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons . To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains . On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail . They learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time . They tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey . Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds . This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking . Candy is not allowed . Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy . Nourishing meals Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs . The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day . Soup is often the important dish at supper . Homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins . The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality . The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day . Outdoor exercises Even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program . Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule . A vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking . Healthier children Since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof . Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen . The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment . Buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf . Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit . He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below . `` Good old iron compass '' ! ! He thought . A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights . The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream . Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate . And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state's history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails . Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight . Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail . The state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks . And once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems . From Burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent , N. Y. . But what came in was piling up . The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N. H. . When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too . The question was `` Where to land '' ? ? There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont . Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged `` Jenny '' and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base . The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions . Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone . Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry , Vermont National Guard , laid out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone Hill . The `` Barre Aviation Field '' was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood . Though the makeshift airports were ready , the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule . They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 , planes . It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air . They had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals . Down in Concord , New Hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time : Robert S. Fogg , a native New Englander , had been a World War 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport . Tall , wiry , dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history . Piloting a Curtiss Navy MF flying boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America . During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes . In Concord , Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings . Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map . The ship was a Waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind . A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the Waco was entered to compete in the `` On-to-Spokane '' Air Derby of 1927 . As a matter of fact , Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers . So with all this experience , Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract . His work began just six days after the flood . By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier . The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right , and used Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't . Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory . Each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River . `` But Fogg '' , they countered , `` we can't get over there . And besides you seem to make it all right here '' . It took a tragedy to bring things to a head . After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field . Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover , Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed , and his pilot , Lt. Franklin Wolfe , badly injured . With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside . Faced with this situation , Postmaster Charles F. McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin . A long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it . With a wary eye on the farmer's bull , Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth . As a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling . With these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco , Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21 , 1927 . Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches . During the second week of operations , Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department , asking him to `` put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip '' . Since Fogg's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions . Over the weeks , America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation . Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home . Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them . A sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit . The airman's stock answer to `` Weren't you cold '' ? ? Became `` Yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it '' ! ! As daylight began to show through the frosty windows , Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield , Vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings . Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station . `` Ceilings '' were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions . Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell . Out at the airport each morning , Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar . ( He'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover . ) Wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition . Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead . Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed . Plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , Fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation . Often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad . When driving rain or mist socked in one valley , Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes . The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips . It ticked over smoothly , idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen , and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field . Sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs '' high over the clouds . There he'd take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him . Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems . At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable . Usually back in Concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip . Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country . The flyer had his share of near-misses . At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated . Once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up . At a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream . Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet . One afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field . Are you retiring now ? ? If so , are you saying , `` Where did the last few years go ? ? How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? ? What do I do now '' ? ? Yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly . Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire . We always thought we would die with our boots on . Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans . Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon . Still , it seems in the far future . Suddenly , one day , up it pops ! ! Sixty-five years and you've had it ! ! So , now what ? ? Oh sure ! ! You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way . But ! ! It never seemed real ; ; never seemed as if it could happen to you ; ; only to the other fellow . Now ! ! Here it is ! ! How am I going to live ? ? What am I going to do ? ? Where do I go from here ? ? A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers . Are you one of these ? ? If so , you are of the old school . You are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose ends . Everything must balance to the last penny . Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every other word . You never are late for work and seldom absent . Actually , you can take no special credit for this . It is the way you were taught and your way of life . All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; ; your stock in trade ; ; your livelihood . However , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing . Your way doesn't seem to be so darned important any more . You realize you are getting in the old fogy class . To put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded . What's happened ? ? The answer is a new era . Now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and I.B.M. machines . The Planning Dept. comes into existence . All sorts of plans come to life . This is followed by a boom in conferences . Yes sir ! ! Conferences become very popular . When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on . That's called progress ! ! The new way of life ! ! Let's face it ! ! You had your day and it was a good day . Let this generation have theirs . Time marches on ! ! Well , to get back to the problem of retirement . Every retiring person has a different situation facing him . Some have plenty of money -- some have very little money . Some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids . Some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments . Some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass . Some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) -- some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything . Well , whatever you have , that's it ! ! You've got to learn to live with it . Now ! ! The question is `` How are you going to live with it '' ? ? You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot . Yes ! ! You can do this . But , if you do , your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged . It seems to me , the first thing you've got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be . Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life . One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life . You've got to do something . Many of you will say , `` Well , what can I do '' ? ? Believe me ! ! There are many , many things to do . Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl . If you can't think of a thing to do , try something -- anything . Maybe you will surprise yourself . True ! ! We are not all great artists . I , frankly , can't draw a straight line . Maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering around with the old paints ? ? You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it . Anyway , I'll bet you have a lot of fun . Do you like to sew ? ? Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ? Do you love to run up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? ? If you do , go to it . There is always a market for this line of work . Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work . Where sewing is concerned , I'm a total loss . When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on , or get out the safety pins . Then again , there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs . Not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you . Well ! ! How's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? ? Some people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time . How about the art of cooking ? ? Do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? ? There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary . Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood . Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc. . Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? ? Outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come up with nothing at all , but then again , you might turn out some dandy little gadgets . Some women get a real thrill out of housework . They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball . Maybe that's your forte . It certainly isn't mine . I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs . Perhaps you would like to become a writer . This gives you a wide and varied choice . Will it be short stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children's stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious ? ? Ever since I was a child , I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing . If you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection . Don't be discouraged ! ! This is just being a normal writer . Just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade . Few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me . But , it could happen , and it may happen to you . Then there's always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires ? ? I can hear some of you folks protesting . You say , `` But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby . I haven't got that kind of money '' . True ! ! It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free . How about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? ? Then , take flowers . They are many and varied . Also , there's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you . It's getting interested in something that counts . As for me , I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( I love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands . So far , the covers have never been off the boxes . I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now . So in closing , fellow retired members , I advise you to make the most of each day , enjoy each one to the n'th degree . Travel , if you can . Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet . Good Luck ! ! To one and all -- Good Days ahead ! ! An important criterion of maturity is creativity . The mature person is creative . What does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? ? When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual . `` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed . Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character . All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own . While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability . An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie . Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination . This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms . It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world . In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality . The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 . In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more . It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator . Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself . We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities . We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles . By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be . We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that `` Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation '' . So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created . Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy . Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ? Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity . Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ; that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation . Perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance . Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women . Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both . Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place . That is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment . If the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours . The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose . First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen . One thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act . Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion . The hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations . ( Hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane . ) Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse . As might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity . It is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ; ; so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations . But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs . Some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood . More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration . Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated . These cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds . In recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention . Obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation . Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ? Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage . If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it . As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina . This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act . The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation . This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control . But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman . That is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological . Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved . By using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape . In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl . She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object . Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment . It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation . When no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves . Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value . Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints . The importance of loving tenderness is obvious . The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels . Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin . But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times . These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse . The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind . They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; ; at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making . In fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon . Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration . The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all . Such talk is seriously in error . Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically . The insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen . The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it . Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation . The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire . The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax . This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife . Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period . The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them . The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again . This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered . He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost . Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire . A final word . The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman . Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment . Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse . Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid . If the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older . Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled The Nude : A Study In Ideal Form , Kenneth Clark declares : `` The human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations . It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' . Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form . The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality . Differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds . Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations . Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never seen her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having `` shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period '' . Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions . The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons . The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration '' . One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected . I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism '' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit . In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony . The partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy . At its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares . Everything else is closed away . This is the ideal . But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved . Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship . In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive . But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed . In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships . It is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act . It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband . The whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs . Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that . But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed . Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy . Yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly . The meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards . To many experts , this trend was inevitable . They consider it simply a sign of our times . Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority . It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role . `` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions . `` It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself . A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too '' . Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . It can , in fact , wreck a marriage . When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her . And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy . On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity . He is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well . `` A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness '' , declares Dr. Calderone . This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health . `` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded . To win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer . Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison . While he was in custody his wife divorced him . More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor . This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations . To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores . Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them . One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties . Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis . After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor . Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed . The wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage . She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Don't rock the boat '' . Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage . Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area . More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home . Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives . The wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job . Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated . Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy . `` The pattern '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' . No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world . After all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr. Schillinger points out . There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom . Furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around . They aren't `` frigid '' and they aren't homosexual ; ; they're just restrained in all of life . They like to be dominated . One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor . Asked why , he replied primly : `` Because that's no activity for a gentleman '' . But such cases were , in the past , unusual . Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept . Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed . This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner . In those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . `` Grandma wasn't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the '90s . Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were . When was the turning point ? ? When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ? Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin . Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs . Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male . Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance . She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless . She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up . `` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned . A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' . And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response . Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax . They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response . In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men . According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner . Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities . Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them . An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under . `` When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate . Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' . One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man . But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity . Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list . In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need . Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion . If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern . Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up . On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable . Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted . In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick . `` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares . `` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage . And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . `` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps . He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish . He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' . Too many husbands , Dr. Schillinger continues , worry about `` how well they're doing '' , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play . She gave herself a title , Lady Diana Harrington . The New York D.A. gave her another , The Golden Girl of cafe society . Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute . And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' . Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor . She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . She never hid the fact that she liked to play . Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial '' . It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot ( Mickey ) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl . ( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls . ) Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course . She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns . It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best . Clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : `` This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society . `` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County . In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him . `` At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey . He was the official procurer for King Farouk , now in exile . She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty . She lied in order to get it . `` We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country . She has been acting as a prostitute . `` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' . Diane sobbingly denied this to the court . `` That's a lie . I never gave that boy a cent . I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend '' , she said . During the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement . `` Diane is the type of girl '' , Jelke said , `` who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor '' . But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her `` boy friends '' . She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor '' instead of a chaperone . As she told it , `` He's a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 '' . She was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive . She had talked her `` boy friend '' into sending her to New York to take a screen test . The screen test was never made -- but Diane was . She quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business . She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke . An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield , the famous producer '' . The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows . `` I'd love to audition for you '' , she gushed . The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment . She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance . After a few minutes he said , `` I can't use you if you dance like that . I'd like to see you dance nude '' . She hastily complied . Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again . She developed another quaint habit . Even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique . When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` If you go home now , I'll scream '' . More often than not he would bow to the inevitable . One who needed no such threats was a French financier . One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel . She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday . In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her . `` Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers '' . The Greek evidently fell for her , `` Monsieur X '' recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables . She could do no wrong at the tables that time . And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way . Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris . No one ever learned what happened to the Greek . The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome . She teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious . To climax her Roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help . It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night . Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental . `` There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors . `` The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent . The hotel staff , as well as residents of the Excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall . `` They were wearing nothing but their scratches . They were asked to leave the hotel . No charges were filed '' . The girls , after dressing , were indignant . `` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed . `` We are Americans '' . In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador . With the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad . Of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do . By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world . She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt . A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way : `` It was a strange relationship . Pulley Bey spoke no English . Diane spoke no Italian or French . She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet . `` Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continued . It seemed as though she were always auditioning . No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk . Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key . She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her . Tewfik Badrawi , Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company . `` So extensive became her circle of admirers '' , Egyptian police said , `` that her escapades caused distrust '' . The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world , but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down . When Farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , Pulley Bey . They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport . The cagey Pulley Bey , who spoke no English , had taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the country without his approval . Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United States . And return to the United States she did , into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office . Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio's , an excellent Italian restaurant . Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney . With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York . It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington '' . Several years ago she married a Houston business man , Robert Graham . She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia . Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring . Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute . The next time the police saw her she was dead . It was September 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles . She had had a party with a regular visitor , Dr. William W. McClellan . McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction , was with her when she died . He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time . When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police . When the police arrived , they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently . The blonde's nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her . Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls . An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body . Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her . `` I think that maybe she wanted it this way '' , a vice squad cop said . `` A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date . She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens . At least she never knew what the bottom was like '' . I am a carpet salesman . I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East . We cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores . I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting . There is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream . From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare . People come to me with confidence . They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little . But I knowingly abuse their confidence . Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer , accompanied by a friend , visited him in Bakersfield , California , several months ago as a prospective patient . `` Doctor '' Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes . Then , by squeezing her foot three times , he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . She had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . ( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it . ) He knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo . Yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assured her . Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health ? ? The human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light . For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue . Continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her : `` Don't you worry . This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body '' . `` Cancer '' ! ! Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked . `` You didn't tell me I had cancer '' . `` You have it , all right . But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about . Why , I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body '' . He urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 . When she said that she didn't have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one . He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away . Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day . After another treatment with the machine , he told her that `` her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts '' . He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine . When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain . Leaving Lee's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue . For several days , she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment . Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines . For Mrs. Shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee -- and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau . And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee . The charge : violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs . The sentence : 360 days' confinement in the county jail . An isolated case of quackery ? ? By no means . Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases . The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts . With these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age . He milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer . The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 -- anything the traffic will bear . He may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' -- or what have you . Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence . The medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines . His plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions . According to the Food And Drug Administration ( FDA ) , `` Doctor '' Ghadiali , Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique , and Dr. Wilhelm Reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10,000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines . Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business . Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland . Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually . You will come up with a frightening total . That's why the FDA , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , and the National Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually . The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history . Similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high . For example , the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago . Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer . In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative . The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course . But it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away . By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity . Typically , Sarah Gross and Mr. A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks . Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her . As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony . She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized . Mr. A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself . Mr. A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man . `` That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose '' , he says today . `` Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments '' . And there was the case of Tom Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine . After his pains got worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung . Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive . But he's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor . But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . In such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . Moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide . For instance : In Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a `` magic spike '' -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all . `` Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have '' , said the company . Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice . Doris Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in Spokane . Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) . His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water . Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , Carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water . Inevitably , Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds . Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her . ( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death . ) In California , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer . He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each . When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer . By no means are these isolated cases . `` Unfortunately '' , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court '' . Death ! ! Have no doubt about it . That's where device quackery can lead . The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands . Who are the victims of the device quacks ? ? Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target . Says Wallace F. Jannsen , director of the FDA's Division of Public Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks '' . The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice . They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged . Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year . His grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school . Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned . Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag . The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick `` Bugs Bunny '' because his teeth protruded . When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested . During the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance . Richard Stewart is no special case . `` The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field . What do parents need to know about those `` years of the braces '' in order not to waste a child's time and their money ? ? How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ? Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ? ? What is it likely to cost ? ? Tooth fit explained occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed . Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for . One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth . A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion . These two basic malformations have , of course , many variations . A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions : A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw . Crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth . Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close . Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close . The eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs . Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row . Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition . However , this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family . Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth ; ; but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect . Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long . If a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble . If baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place . Correction can save teeth every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth . Some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed . In certain cases , as in Dick Stewart's , a child's personality is affected . Yet from the dentist's point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons . Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots . This serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults . Then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay . `` For these and other reasons '' , says Dr. Brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth '' . The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system . Because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition . Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping . The when and how of straightening `` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 '' , says Dr. Brodie . In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy . Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; ; they are not anchored directly to the bone . Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided . What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office ? ? On her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints '' -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws . If he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs . This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone . As the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved . This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster . `` If teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place '' , explains Dr. Brodie . `` Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face '' . During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear . Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay . When in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered . Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition . During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth . Last comes the retention stage . Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position . But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place . Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth . Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day . Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist . How long will this take ? ? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months . Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more . An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct . What is the cost ? ? The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country . Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago . An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000 . `` Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner '' , says Dr. Brodie . To become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist . `` Costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher '' , says Dr. Brodie . `` Fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago '' . The reason ? ? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field . Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years . In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee . Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents . Research helps families growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists . Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children's births . `` In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at ; ; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent '' , he says . `` Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do '' . This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment . For example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another . In the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them . Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately . In other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment . The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth . `` Nature often takes care of the problem '' , says Dr. Brodie . `` A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity '' . That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist's advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early . `` Both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so . Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment '' , he urges . Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research . Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money . Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . Prevention is best as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be . `` After your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first dental appointment '' , Dr. Brodie advises . `` Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year '' . To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things : He can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth . If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed . In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them . From time to time the medium mentions other people `` around him '' , who were `` on the other side '' , and reports what they are saying . After a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames . As the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements . There are a few prognoses of coming events . Another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading . Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual . Not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased . In fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . However that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons . Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . They may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a `` control '' who speaks through an entranced sensitive . What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation . But it is not really only a conversation . Many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind . He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ; ; it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ! ! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on `` pre-conscious '' moods and to clarify them . However , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading . Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing . For this was to be a `` proxy sitting '' . As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive . Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` New Research On Survival After Death '' , Spring 1958 ) . He remarked : `` It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' . The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated . One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter . If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions . All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions . Sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are used . Here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him . In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else . He gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator . As always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter . So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium's ESP and the absent sitter's mind . It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range . Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him . Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case . If you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! ! An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ? It is , of course , easy to see how `` J '' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another . `` A journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people . And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal . One sitter may think `` a leather couch '' identifies a reading as surely directed to him ; ; to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` Atta boy '' ! ! To get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him . If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ? Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience '' ? ? Conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant : `` He had four children , two sets of twins . After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry . Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road . He died of typhoid in 1921 '' . Methods have been developed of assigning `` weights '' to statements ; ; that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with R are more common than those beginning with Z ; ; that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ; ; that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox . So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights . Specific dates would be important , as would double names . Various categories have been explored to find out about these `` empirical probabilities '' against which to measure the readings . In the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements . It is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself . Or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? ? That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out . So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) . He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his . All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading . That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls . Conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material . And there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated . In another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements . Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ? Does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ? ? It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her `` hits '' . Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best . Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses . `` I feel cold '' , the medium says , or `` My leg aches '' , `` My head is heavy '' . Or perhaps she hears words or sounds : `` There's such a noise of loud machinery '' , or `` I hear a child crying '' , or `` He says we're all here and glad to see you '' . Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' . The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions . Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there . If pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer . If asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others . Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all . Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another's personalities , moods , intentions . Of course , there is an element of training here : these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power . Simply using it increases its intensity , I was told by one sensitive . Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery . Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value . It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning . If communication with an entity on the `` other side '' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism . During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons . But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; ; taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement . In this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained . Though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name `` Hill '' , for instance . One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter . Farming is confining . The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock . Livestock must be tended every day , routinely . A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens . Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season . The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily . He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life . The farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night . Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . No matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up . It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . Production may fall far below expectations . Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops . Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings , even into his capital . Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year . The high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities . Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities . If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high . A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer . It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn . There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job . The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost . This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented . If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid . If it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of . Advantages A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children . It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air . The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability . Caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work . Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs . For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income . It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health . Generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city . The savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed . Usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more . Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same . A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably . Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational . For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . Land , labor , and equipment needed Part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal . It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . General requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below . Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 . Land Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs . You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you'll need more land . In deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect . But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work . The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision . Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . This is a highly speculative venture . Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract . When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm . Labor If you have a year-round , full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help . As a rule , part-time farmers hire little help . In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 . List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month . You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work . Equipment If you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools . You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however . For larger plantings , you'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating . If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) . These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises . You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs . If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . Selecting a farm Before you look for a farm you'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake ; ; and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent . Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture . If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm . Location nearness to work . -- Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm . The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable . Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road . Nearness to markets . -- If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby . If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city . Kind of neighborhood . -- Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes . There are slums in the country as well as in the city . Few rural areas are protected by zoning . A tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value . Facilities in the area . -- Check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them . Find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality . If these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect . You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them . You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water . If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled . A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . Pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble . The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses . Topography and soil Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ? If you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist . Soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones . Small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop . The house Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ? ? How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ? If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements . Buying a farm The value of the farm to you will depend on -- Its worth as a place to live . The value of the products you can raise on it . The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision . Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town . Take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work . Next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm . To do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm . List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year . Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices . The total is the probably gross income from farming . To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming . Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment . Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family . It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it . Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way . Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned . One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers . The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers . Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect . And still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot . Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs . Counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection . Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client's chances ? ? Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies . Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow . But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York . In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship ; ; in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard . These trials were properly termed `` political cases '' in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences . But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ? ? Of what new course could it mark the beginning ? ? The Eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future . It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are Jews . As such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a `` message '' . `` It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial '' -- said Ben Gurion , `` and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history '' . How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ? ? And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ? These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case . It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism . But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment . In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument . One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages . Shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism . Yes , he believed that the Jews were `` enemies of the Reich '' , and such a belief is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites ; ; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things . The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself . In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent . Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer . Not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let's try it '' . At any rate , the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent . But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it . If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ? The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government . Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solutions '' for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . In other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder . This , in fact , it turned out to be . Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes ; ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually . What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial . No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of Jews , as do others like them today . The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others . Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of `` mere '' anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ? ? The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' . But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it . Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states . Certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors . Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ? ? The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; ; clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . `` Is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? ? The Trial should have asked the nations . But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it . Finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e. , Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ? ? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? ? Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ? As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) . Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe . It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors' accounts . In Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff . Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended . After a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 . The peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy . In New York City in 1958 , the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device . He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy . A year later in Albany , N.Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association . Immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience . These incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue . It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies . It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries . Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level . Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached . `` All too frequently '' , points out James O'Gara , managing editor of Commonweal , `` Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades '' . All too often our language is unduly harsh . The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between Catholics and Non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning . Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many Non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed . Family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring . Pope Pius 12 , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications '' . This means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring . These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning . The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons . The Roman Catholic Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning . Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice . There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement . The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law . The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods . The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end . This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements . Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race . Moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception . Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them . Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable . But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them . Why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ? It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof , upon others . It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past . Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress . Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful . With over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens . The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end . That tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society . That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today . Up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law . This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries . Today , the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction . The various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally . In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race '' . Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage . One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives . In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate . In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere . Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action . In March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control . `` As to the necessity '' , the committee declared , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right '' . Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty . What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical . This development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the Aj . The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning . It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives . The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right . The general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception '' . An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty . This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country . Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control . For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far-reaching . To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment . This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief . Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes . Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin . Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself . On April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea . She carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America . Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay . When she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation . The captain was gone , and the mate was gone . The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman . What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ? ? What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ? These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time . For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports . All told , they offered a highly confused picture . But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information . Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage . Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . Second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas . The name : Henry Hudson . This is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine : The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years . Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East . In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia . Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again . In 1609 , the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors . This time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America . His chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River -- but it produced no northwest passage . When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived . The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship . He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth . By springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince of Wales . He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded . The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear . A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies . One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded . In fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes . But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north . Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' . He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' . ( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait . ) In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back . Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway . Even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames . Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters . On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain . On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case . On the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic . Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before . Of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson , his second son . The mate , Robert Juet , who had kept the journal on the Half Moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent . Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis . But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find . Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer . And he refused to be anything else . It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships . He was a Londoner , married , with three sons . ( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage . ) In 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames . There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a `` clerk '' . Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores . He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up . For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward . On May 11 , she reached Iceland . Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie Bay '' . The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome . With Hudson looking on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon , Edward Wilson . The issue was settled on shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England . With difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland . Early in June , the Discovery passed `` Desolation '' ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the `` Furious Overfall '' . Floating ice bore down from the north and west . Fog hung over the route constantly . Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet . The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole . As the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay , an inlet of the Great Strait . After finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled . The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing . For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd . The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason . A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther . Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable . He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew . Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives . When Hudson had finished , the `` town meeting '' broke down into a general , wordy argument . One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England . Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home . The statement was effective . The meeting broke up . Hudson was free to sail on . All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands . On August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans . To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds . To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet . Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers . Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson Bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific . After three weeks' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas . The ship halted . The great `` sea to the westwards '' was a dead end . This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery . For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea , but the solid bulk of the North American continent . This was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure . Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition . North and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week . Hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to England through the `` Furious Overfall '' was again filling with ice . The men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking . Once more , Juet's complaints were the loudest . Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty . Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial . The trial was held September 10 . Hudson , presiding , heard Juet's defense , then called for testimony from crew members . Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward . Hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins . Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship . Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward . Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay . The new mate was Robert Bylot , talented but inexperienced . There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves . The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson's sworn enemies . As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew's respect for him . Once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed . Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship . Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured . The anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe . Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North . Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies . Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . The grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay . Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier . Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 . By October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 . Within a few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons . The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire . The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river . Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland . The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders . For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota . When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business . On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts . These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun . In 1802 Henry referred to `` our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack . They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills . It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States . In September 1817 at Fort Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie Du Chien . During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England . Upon arriving at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams , Secretary of State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with `` Missouri and Illinois Territories '' . This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements . '' The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at `` the Forks '' ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien . It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats . With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake , across into Lake Traverse , and down the Red . They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820 . This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk Ab1,040 . Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food . Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien , until then the most advanced United States post . In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , Colonel Josiah Snelling . It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good . Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers . Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall . He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States . Observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise . Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . Alexander McDonnell , governor of Red River , and James Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company , ordered such `` sundry articles '' to a value of Ab4,500 . For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement . As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory . Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John Halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to `` the Forks '' in rafts . `` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment . '' Despite Company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at `` great expense as well as danger '' . At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling . The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States . In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling . Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River . At the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 . Its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 . The resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River . While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . Accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company , some settlers went into trade . The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs . Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs . In June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals of the Company's trade and power '' . To reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country . Others carried pemmican from `` the Forks '' to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement . This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee . The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel . The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor . Indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray . Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive . A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : `` thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house '' . A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' . Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression . One wrote : `` ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups '' . A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia `` look like the latter end of original sin and hard times '' . A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' . Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' . A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : `` my girl is none of your one-horse girls . She is a regular stub and twister , double geered . She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . Humor found many modes of expression . A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : `` what has become of Halda and Laura ? ? When you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by God '' . William R. Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History , liked to tease his wife in his letters . After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : `` ( dear Wife ) if I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married . I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' . A Yank , disturbed by his increasing corpulence , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself '' . Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : `` now I lay me down to sleep , the gray-backs o'er my body creep ; ; if they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord their jaws to break '' . Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age . But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine . Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` Fall-in '' and the other `` Close-up '' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up '' . The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people . They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body . One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea . Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; ; but a much more common designation was `` the sh-ts '' . A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : : `` I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts '' . Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia quickstep '' . A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : `` I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days . I eat too much eggs and poark . It sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me '' . A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : `` I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same '' . The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances . Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table . Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee . In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor . Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i.e. , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written . Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads . A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated : `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing . I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' . A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter . Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time '' . Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported : `` the Yankees keep shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink , so I will close '' . 3 , the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives . But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; ; and these , full of homely advice , are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters . Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community . Occasionally they would write to the slaves . Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro `` body servants '' to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes . Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families . Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home . Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling . Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville . But these comments are hardly printable . An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : `` they thout I was a saint . I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all . I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappy's . But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk '' . Some of the letters were pungently expressive . An Ohio soldier who , from a comrade just returned from leave , received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` dear Sis . Alf sed he heard that you and Hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse . I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf Dyer and let that orney thefin , drunkard , damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you , the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion , he is too orney for hel . I will shute him as shore as I sea him '' . Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions . A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : `` dear Pa . Went out a skouting yesterday . We got to one house where there were five secessionists . They brok & run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them . Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun '' . Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers . A Mississippi soldier wrote : `` our General Reub Davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass '' . An Alabamian wrote : `` Col. Henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn '' . A Floridian stated that his officers were `` not fit to tote guts to a bear '' . On December 9 , 1862 , Sergeant Edwin H. Fay , an unusual Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana , wrote his wife : `` I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw . His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps . Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader . He is not worth shucks . But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command '' . Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers . A Massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin , wrote : `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks . They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average , the drunken rascals '' . Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : `` I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago '' . Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : `` I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) '' . No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors . One Federal soldier wrote : `` the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do(c)ters and offersey when this war is over '' . Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : `` the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment . I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) Union quackery '' . The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . The Rebs were , to a Massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame '' . A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that `` they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw . They looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings . '' Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary : `` I strolled among the Alabamans on the right , found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe , their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect . They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all ' '' . In a similar vein , but writing from the opposite side , Thomas Taylor , a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers , in a letter to his wife , stated : `` you know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe , by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is Booty . The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America . And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world . Thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence . 1 ) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions . What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred . 2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness . Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years . The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point . Nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula . Of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century United States . Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street . It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine . After all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control . Anyone's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes . In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose . A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land . But we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends . Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States . Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution . Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy . And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry , Nathan Hale , Andrew Jackson , Davy Crockett , Theodore Roosevelt and many , many more . Therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts . 1 ) Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all . 2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend . Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression . Related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence . Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this . Enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales , Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition . Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material . Naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant . As long as his material is Americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears `` democratic '' to his audience , he remains satisfied . From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore . On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation . On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways . After all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates . In addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society . The problems confuse even the experts . For that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed . Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four . They have widely varying backgrounds and aims . They have little `` esprit de corps '' . The outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . His love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote . Folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such . The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field . The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; ; he hunts folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reasons that many persons hunt game ; ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located . Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century German scholarship . Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found . Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines . The commercial propagandist , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine . His standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications . Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors . The work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience . Publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material . The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in . As a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there . And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone . If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public . And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each . Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ? When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? ? Is the writer propagandistic ? ? Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ? ? Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ? When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged . In the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale . Robert Frost , for instance , writes about rural life in New England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems . This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet '' , simply because he is a rural one . In the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material . Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People , Yes . The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass . Folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it . The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude . In fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits . Nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the `` good old days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk . As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade . The coalition was to prove inadvisable . O'Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others' . He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body . He carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands . He killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately . The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them . Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol . He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths . He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; ; he divided humanity into `` right guys '' and `` wrong guys '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under . He had what was described by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . He walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns . Landesco thought him `` just a superior sort of plugugly '' but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath . He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king . O'Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North Side's Little Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner . He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien . The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking . At the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg . Because of this he was known as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) . In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out . He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors . He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; ; two years later he served another three months for assault . Those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective . On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed . On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building ; ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30,000 in bribes , it was estimated . As promptly as Torrio , O'Banion jumped into bootlegging . He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money . Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution . He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' . But whose requirements ? ? Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic . There was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time : Q. `` Who'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards '' ? ? A. O'Banion , in his pistol pocket '' . But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans . To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay . The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West . It was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen . The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time . It included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes . When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers . Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling house . `` But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at once '' . In fact , O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin . There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip . Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds . This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as `` Belshazzar feasts '' , at which `` politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels '' . Pasley continued : `` They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 '' . However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever . O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal . On Election Day -- November 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes . The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates . This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone . In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking . He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness . They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest . To settle this slight , O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy . At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters . O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach . A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress . O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested . That sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense . A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through . One of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation . O'Banion's reaction was : `` Three hundred dollars ! ! To them bums ? ? Why , I can get them knocked off for half that much '' . Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen . But in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message : `` Say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred . He says he don't want no trouble '' . But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman . For three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing . They had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero . When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month . In six months O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb . These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ; ; once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will . The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and West Sides . But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate . At last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession . O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era -- the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . Here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky . These 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men , who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water . A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption . The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco . The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves . Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times . Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood . One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ; ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast . Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; ; they are far more common in the Pacific . Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years . In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay . A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been . In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes . The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement . An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific . But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest . While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour . The greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ; ; Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity . In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour . Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable . Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest . Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights . On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells . Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened . The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore . The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones . They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions . Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers . This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives . Reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish . At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach . Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore . After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground . When a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides . Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them . A tsunami is not a single wave but a series . The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over . The waves may keep coming for many hours . Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest . Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , one of the world's foremost marine geologists . He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves . Their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling . The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest . On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ; ; they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come . In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high . The highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at Pololu Valley . Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon . During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night . The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance . The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet . Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands . The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff . It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . Ordinary water tides are disregarded . But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit . This in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress . Such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch Harbor . The moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system . This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs . Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami . By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific . The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps . All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly . Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 17:07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time . It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 . They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows . But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000 . There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage . But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough . In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves . The key to the world of geology is change ; ; nothing remains the same . Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man . The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this . Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break . Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; ; often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ; ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried . Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them . The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized . The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports . We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled . These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core . Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths . Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts . ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . ( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ? Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields . In the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources . We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate . The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet . The restless earth and its interior At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake . A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll . In Ireland's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' . Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name . The cry `` Garryowen '' ! ! Bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea . Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment , `` The Fighting Seventh '' . Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables . But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night . Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler . Wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper . The truth is , however , that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil . Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it . Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces . The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop H , 7th Cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan . Outside of combat , he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot . First of all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside , especially when he's an armchair trooper . Second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it's on maneuvers . In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed . But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it's easy . Chandler understood this and expected the worst . But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early . Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice . Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident . He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade . There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded . He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work . Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses . He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well . But for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold . He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh . That saved Mel Chandler . Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army . He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment . For example , it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn . It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop Aj . But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment . Maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain Chandler still with them . It was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor . But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , `` Garryowen '' . The final proof was a small incident . It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march . In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen . The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding , his wife and their two children . And when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best . Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding , the Jewish officer from Chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange . For Marvin Goulding , like Giovanni Martini , the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message , or Margarito Lopez , the one-man Army on Leyte , was a Garryowen , through and through . It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment . And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen . He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment . One of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop . Even the mess sergeant , Bill Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range . The troop received a new leader , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll , fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status . Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool . So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before . When the Korean war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2 , , the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition . Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2 . Just a month after the Korean War broke out , the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat . From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea . One night on the Naktong River , Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps . The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side . The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where . At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no longer . Then it came , against Troop Aj . The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine guns , attacked the position held by Chandler's men . They came in waves . First came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram . They were followed by crack North Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another . They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead . Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear . Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength . He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill . One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army . Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight . Then Mel Chandler started up the hill . He took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run . The first thing he knew the words `` Garryowen '' ! ! Burst from his throat . His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran . The Koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire . Chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran . It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen . He had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge . Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again . But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously . He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire . Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot . They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack . Marvin Goulding saw what was happening . He turned to his platoon . `` Okay , men '' , he said . `` Follow me '' . Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , `` Garryowen '' ! ! On his lips , his men following . But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead . For an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead . Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' ! ! They charged into the enemy like wild men . That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun . Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack . Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon . The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies . Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds . Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived . Today he is a major -- in the Regular Army . So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment . After years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of Garryowen And Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit . The battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off . For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment . Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno , who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 . From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno . Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him . But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him . He was a member of The Fighting Seventh . Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then . Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare . During the Civil War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 . He finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army . I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them . If they were , Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky , and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about . I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions . Assumption 1 . The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; ; and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States . I speak of `` the largest possible measure '' because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around . Assumption 2 . These conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world Communism . This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions ; ; and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . Moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote . Assumption 3 . It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy . Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means . But dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . Peace is a worthy objective ; ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight . Freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ; ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed . Justice is a worthy objective ; ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer . Prosperity is a worthy objective ; ; but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made . It may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of Soviet Communist power . The uses of power This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used . This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power . I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be . And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus . One was demonstrably false ; ; the other , for the most part , true . The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power . I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future . I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth . Suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets' position : `` There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean . Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast . Half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people '' . Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity . Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength . If we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage . U.S. `` prestige '' The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years . The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it . The argument was typically advanced in terms of U.S. `` prestige '' . Prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ; ; and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading . Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill . But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake . Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be . The thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it . The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead . This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side . To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern . Still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves . Here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are : Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ? ? And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ? ? Communist gains In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests . Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence . Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages . Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level . The Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West . Thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to `` neutralize '' a country . The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy . And this may be as far as the process will go . The Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office . To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring . Six years ago French Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp . Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism ; ; Cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist . Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West . Today Sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all of its `` neutralist '' pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy . Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West . In the Middle East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp . Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line . A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve . Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West . Today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit . Latin America was once an area as `` safe '' for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon . Today it is up for grabs . One Latin American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast . In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country -- save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where Castroism and Anti-Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause . Only in Europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface . The strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany . Opportunities missed What have we to show by way of counter-successes ? ? We have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain . There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about . There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests . There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist . Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala . And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that Communist government ; ; we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup d'etat . We served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery . The first rattle of the machine guns , at 7:10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear . `` Sounds exactly like last time '' . The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven . The middle-aged man said over and over , `` Why did I come here , why did I come here '' . Then he was sick . Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars . Then the lights went out . This was my second day in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , and my thoughts were none too brave . Where was my flashlight ? ? Where should I go ? ? To my room ? ? Better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick . Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters . Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby . A woman with a small boy slipped in between them . `` Please '' , she said , `` please '' . She held out her hand to show that she had money . The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office . But what was the story ? ? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far ? ? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ? ? `` Let's play hero '' , I said . `` Let's go to the roof and see '' . Gunfire saves the moon By 7:50 the answer was plain . There had been an eclipse of the moon . A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms . The din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around . How quaint it all seemed the next day . A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons `` who became excited and left without paying their checks '' . But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later . And no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet Holes . I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets . Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered . In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble . Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door . What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick . This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11 , 1960 ) . And now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege . The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more . Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death . `` And it's all the more tragic because it's so little deserved '' , said Mr. J. J. A. Frans , a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization . We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.N. flag . Practically all the people of Laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows . They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls . Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are . They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; ; yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians . Life must be kept in harmony `` . What matters here is family loyalty ; ; faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ; ; and to live in harmony with nature '' . Harmony in Laos ? ? `` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans . He spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest . The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River . Shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside . Even life in harmony with death . For so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast . To many a Frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti . Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe . The Pathet Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft . The Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds . In six years , U.S. aid had amounted to more than $1.60 for each American -- a total of three hundred million dollars . We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants . Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ? To find out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist China ( map , page 250 ) . We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly . We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash . In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire . `` We '' were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; ; Boun My , our interpreter ; ; and myself . Boun My -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise . He had attended three universities in the United States . But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang Prabang . Before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just about impossible . Prime minister moves fast Alas , so it almost proved for us , too . To go outside the few cities required permits . And getting them seemed a life's work . Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts . We were told that to the Pathet Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at least $750 , a fortune in Laos . Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort . Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention . Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere . We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister . Could we be ready in 15 minutes ? ? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off . Prince wears ten-gallon hat And so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas . From his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger . The temperature rose to 105-degrees . With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust . In Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me . Then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls . It was a spleen-crushing day . An hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . More bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well . Then off again , rushing to keep up . We were miserable . But our two Jeep mates -- Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust . Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century -- constructively . Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs . John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development division of USOM , the United States Operations Mission administering U.S. aid . `` What you see are self-help projects '' , John said . `` We ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor . We send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs . That way they have an infirmary for $400 . We have 2,500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools . Ask Mr. Keo '' . Mr. Keo agreed . `` Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them '' , he said . `` Where there was no road , they lived without one . Now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence . That's a big step toward a modern state . You might say we are in the nation-building business '' . In the villages people lined up to give us flowers . Then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine . The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech . The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself . Then we were off again . We did it for three days . But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery . Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze . Then we hung overboard in the water . Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau . The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood , supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song . Strings keep souls in place In the village of Soukhouma , which means `` Peaceful '' , we had a baci . This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies . It takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose . The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string . The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) . The candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables . I was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone's head , where the worthiest spirits reside . Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us . Next he addressed himself to our souls . A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body . Those souls like to wander off , and must be called back . With the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power . Then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists . These were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls . As we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand . It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar . We could see maggots moving . John said : `` I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it's too late for that '' . My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds . Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings . `` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked . `` It means that you have to get ahead '' . When I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . `` I like the tradition '' , a girl said . `` I like to follow the holidays when they come along . But you don't have to worship in the traditional way . You can communicate in your own way . As I see it , there's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' . Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews don't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' . Still another boy asserted : `` To be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; ; it's to be a good person '' . When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It's the same thing '' . This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad . They discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction . The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent . Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple . However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : `` It's the twentieth century , and they don't have to wear beards '' . The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds . `` We were brought up that way '' was one statement which won general assent . `` I want to show respect for my parents' religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism . Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I'll be living in a suburb '' . Intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds . `` When you marry , you want to have things in common '' , a girl said , `` and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background '' . A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious . It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food . Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' . This is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant . The older teens One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented . Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning . This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large -- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females . This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy . In their first two years in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams . However , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts . The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys . The motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different . The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed . One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women . It is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them . In upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality . `` People automatically assume that I'm in college '' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably . However , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college . The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student . She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature . The lower-middle class college student One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost . This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia . What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world . Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class Jewish student . There is , to begin , an important sex difference . Typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college . There are two reasons for this . First , the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's . Second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son . Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home . The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically . One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town . Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school . On the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school . This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College . They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . At the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates . `` It's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked . `` You don't have to watch what you say . Of course , I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there '' . For most Brooklyn College students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family . Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing . However , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents . And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping . `` As long as I'm home , I'll never grow up '' , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly . `` They don't like it if I do anything away from home . It's so much trouble , I don't usually bother '' . For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive . Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting . A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the `` low-down '' on a boy who was going out with his daughter . The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field . Under pressure from parents , the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours . This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature . A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex . The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual . First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights . Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York . It is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps . The great world beyond beckons . But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish . Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe . In general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith . And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years . Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West . There are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry . It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate . `` Almost everybody in the senior class is married '' , students say dogmatically . And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House Plan Association ) that have good news to impart . These announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts . There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . `` Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House '' . The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models . The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy way . The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes . Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking . Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place . The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys . This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) . For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste . This could also be used for any other skin irritation . Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts . `` Female troubles '' of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation . The sufferer drinks tansy tea . Bruises , burns , cuts , etc. , occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too . Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak . ( Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain . ) Salted butter was another cure for bruises . Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ; ; the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts . Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter . `` Butter salve '' or `` butter ointment '' was used for burns , and for bruises as well . This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; ; when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled . Cow's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly . One man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time . A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat '' . Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns . The results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known . To stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds . One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ; ; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection . My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; ; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine . He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; ; there is scarcely a scar showing . Tobacco was common first aid . A `` chaw '' of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing . Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing . One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head . His brother ran a mile to get the father ; ; when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices . Then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place . There was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar . Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic . Until quite recently , `` sterile '' maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; ; they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated . Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound . One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard . Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke . Rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones '' which the pioneer wore or carried . In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County , and one had been in the family for 200 years . Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker . While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation . Since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid . This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) . Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life . Or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears . Old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water . Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance . Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ; ; this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part . As the cloth dried , more of the mixture was applied , and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be `` killed '' . Insect bites were cured in many ways . Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method ; ; `` get a bite , spit on it '' was a proverb . This was used also for bruises . Yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings ; ; not long ago `` Denver Mud '' was most popular . Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived ; ; so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye , they buried themselves in the victim's flesh . Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests . Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing . For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made . For wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief . A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ; ; mud was sometimes used as well as soap . Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings . Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; ; to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900's , was a chore . Bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather . Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests . At times pioneer children got lice in their hair . A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job . To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted . A cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye . As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out . Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed ; ; the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton . Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations . For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth . Itching skin , considered `` just nerves '' , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt . Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped . To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water . They drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution . Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies . Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow . Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead . Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains . Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves . Boils have always been a source of much trouble . A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice . Another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution . This was also used for sores . Another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns . One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or `` fire '' . Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight . This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on . There were many cures for warts . One young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times . Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days . Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ; ; wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that . One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy . Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week . A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way . I know this worked . One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water ; ; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily . Another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment ; ; the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave . As the onion decayed , so did the wart . Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ; ; sore feet by calf's-foot , an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved . Leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard . This does give relief , as I can testify . One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps . Pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient's waist . For sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief . Except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him . In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal . It may , on occasion , be anything but that . However , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine . Again , by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad . This is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas . A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ; ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district . These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis . The Grands Crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them . And certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown . There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper . Some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse . Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the requisites . Wine waiters are something else again ; ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts . Most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself . Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! ! ) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all . This is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter . A really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths . Faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence . The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money . Only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains . Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served . This is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort . It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal . Wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; ; otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it . When stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork . Fat bottles , such as Burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture . Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects . The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it : if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right ; ; if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion . Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it prematurely . The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes . Prolonged vibration is also undesirable ; ; consequently , one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces . If one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time . Light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine . All in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork . No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! ! But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal . A white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; ; for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow . Though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time . It may be a bit cold when poured ; ; but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full . In this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages . The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire . This invariably effaces any wine's character , and drives its fragrance underground . It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums , double Magnums , Jeroboams , Methuselahs , and Imperiales , respectively . Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air . But white wines never ! ! White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness . Thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; ; a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold . Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive . The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air . To quote Professor Saintsbury : `` The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; ; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last '' ! ! This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good . If this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; ; it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk . A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature . By tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well . Thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ; ; very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself . A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea . The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward . Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment . Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle . In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted . Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy . For , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs . Though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten . Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; ; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy . Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more . If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while . Most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ; ; and Alsatians may be . Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : `` Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views '' . Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation . The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer . An excellent crop was expected that year . William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year . Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation . If sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5,000 . Early in January , 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans , and upon learning of Gorham's intention , Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother . The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes . They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and Louisiana law required their removal from the state . Gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved ? ? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves . Henry hid his annoyance , although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother . William , who did not write to Gorham , told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably '' to protect his interests . Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation . If William wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them `` as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age . A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme . Their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement '' . When he heard of his brothers' anger , Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages . If not , he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim . William was adamant on one point : under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom . Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes , Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once , and then send them on to Liberia . Lacking specific instructions , he agreed to William's condition . In March there was a division of the slaves , and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible . Of the fifty-two slaves , Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females . `` I considered that your views would be best carried out '' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation . I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice '' . The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child . If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited . This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed . Each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value . Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150 ; ; ; ; Rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 . In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000 . Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66 . Thus twenty `` black souls '' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men . Giffen extracted one concession from William : the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient . Despite Giffen's warning , Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana . Yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission . According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed . Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement . Otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain '' . On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition . News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers , and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance . Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` Ears of the People on the Plantation , and make them restless & unhappy '' . His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself : to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue . When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey , Gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him . In view of these difficulties , Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana . Giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters . His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April . Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again . During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists . In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North . In New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : `` I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man '' . Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana . She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately . At Lexington , Kentucky , Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result . Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial . Instead of the expected `` annoyances '' due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from `` gentlemen of mark , on whom I had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than I could accept '' . He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of the `` marked attention and civility '' with which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him . The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War . Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans '' . He proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the `` passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high '' . Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom . The women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage . He had a short private talk with each adult slave . Only one objected , but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others . All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce '' . Palfrey agreed ; ; the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account . William's threat that under no conditions would he allow `` freedom-conscious '' slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before . Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience '' . From Cambridge , Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves . In fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased . Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once . When a sailing date of March , 1845 was finally established , Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship . Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration . Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 . The plantation was sold in January , 1845 , and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages . Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work ; ; the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement . On March 21 , 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans , while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation . Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw . Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants . Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot . Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury . After an initial rejection , which he attributed to a `` general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation '' , Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay . When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves . Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared `` all men are born free and equal '' . Nevertheless , Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation . An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free . Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants . Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community , but he had better luck in his other attempts . Mrs. Child , true to her word , helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua , New York . This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep . But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest . Secretary of State Dean Rusk , a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean , has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange . One of his initial acts in office was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs . ( `` In the late forties and fifties '' , Coombs has declared in defining his role , `` two strong new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance . As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm , aimed at the development of people , at the fuller realization of their creative human potential , and a better understanding among them '' . ) Many of the new appointees are art collectors . Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include Renoir , Cezanne , Gauguin , Van Gogh , Toulouse-Lautrec , Degas , Matisse , Picasso , and Walt Kuhn . The Director of the Peace Corps , R. Sargent Shriver , Jr. , a Kennedy brother-in-law , collects heavily among the moderns , including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers . Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet , Femmes dans un Jardin . Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , former President of the Ford Motor Company , comes from a generation different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense , Charles Wilson , who had been head of General Motors . Unlike Wilson , who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism . McNamara is the scholar-businessman . An inveterate reader of books , he chose while working in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann Arbor , almost forty miles away . He selected as Comptroller of Defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former Rhodes Scholar , Charles Hitch , who is author of a study on The Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age . One of the President's special assistants , the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy , was co-author with Henry L. Stimson of the latter's classic memoir , On Active Service . Another , Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. , has won a Pulitzer Prize in history ; ; his wife , Marion , is a portrait painter . The Press Secretary , Pierre Salinger , was a child prodigy as a pianist . ( `` It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who neither know nor understand music '' , he declared not long ago in proposing that White House prizes be awarded for music and art . ) Mrs. Arthur Goldberg , wife of the Secretary of Labor , paints professionally and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District of Columbia . ( `` Artists are always at a new frontier '' , she claims . `` In fact , the search is almost more important than the find '' . ) Mrs. Henry Labouisse , wife of the new director of the foreign aid program , is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie . The list goes on . At last count , sixteen former Rhodes Scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the Administration , second in number only to its Harvard graduates . Besides Schlesinger , the Justice Department's Information Director , Edwin Guthman , has won a Pulitzer Prize ( for national reporting ) . Postmaster General J. Edward Day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , Bartholf Street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense . Two men show promise of playing prominent roles : William Walton , a writer-turned-painter , has been a long-time friend of the President . They arrived in Washington about the same time during the early postwar years : Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts ; ; Walton , after a wartime stint with Time-Life , to become bureau chief for The New Republic . Both lived in Georgetown , were unattached , and shared an active social life . Walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days . Nonetheless , they found common interests . During last year's campaign , Kennedy asked Walton , an utter novice in organization politics , to assist him . Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City . Walton , who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France , combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy . He provoked outraged editorials when , after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with Mrs. Kennedy , he remarked to reporters , `` We just cased the joint to see what was there '' . But his credentials are impeccable . Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation of Lafayette Square . A man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture . A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior . Udall , who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight . But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments . His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow , Arnold Toynbee , and Aaron Copland . Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves . After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members , members of Congress , and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium . The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration . His Ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response . One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan , sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum , would be sent `` on indefinite loan '' to Salem , Illinois , Bryan's birthplace . Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form . They dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which `` dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans '' . Hoping to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized . He is not likely to win this battle easily . In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to `` hustle '' it out of Washington . The last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to Taras Shevchenko , the Ukrainian poet laureate ; ; eleven others were introduced . Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac , and TR.'s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary . The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , `` Instant Stonehenge '' ) , is another of Udall's headaches , since as supervisor of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility for building it . `` Washington '' , President Kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , `` is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm '' . There have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the White House . One of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine . Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson , the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic . Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this . Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.M.S. Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria . It now serves the President in his oval office . Later , browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Des Beaux-Arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe . She traced it to a storage room . With its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House . But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period for the White House ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms . The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them . Her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines . By rough estimate her Committee , headed by Henry Francis Du Pont , contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats . The press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within . A curator has been appointed . A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room . The American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library . Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture , including Dolley Madison's own sofa , to furnish a room in that style . And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret Thompson Biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the State dining room . Woman's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard . One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House . Congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the `` marble monumentality '' of government office buildings . While a Senator , Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater , as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses , all scheduled for razing . What to do about it now that he was President ? ? Only a few days after moving into the White House . Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square . Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President . The situation involved some political perils . One of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged Court of Claims , diagonally across the street from the White House . Logically , it should be moved downtown . But Judge Marvin Jones , senior member of the Court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work . More importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House . There were aesthetic problems as well as political . On delving deeper , Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as `` early nondescript '' . The old Belasco Theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a USO Center . The Dolley Madison House , Walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving . `` The attempt to save the Square's historic value '' , he declares , `` came half a century too late '' . Surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful . The buildings are mostly Georgian . The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did . But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures . He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be . He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart . The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven . And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia . But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth . The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment . No one here pokes fun at manly virtues . And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League . It even affects the faculty . Thus , when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl . President Dickey's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality . This carefree disdain for `` side '' cropped up again in the same television broadcast . Dean Thaddeus Seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival . She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head . So he kissed her . No Dartmouth man was surprised . Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid . For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River . This is in honor of John Ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days . And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today . They are hailed by the nation's press , and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses . Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing . Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own . Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country . Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door . They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to Oak Hill , where there's a lift . The Dartmouth Skiway , at Holt's Ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the East , ranging from novice to expert . Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain . Here , at the Ravine Lodge , President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails . The Lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room . The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country . The cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips . The club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing . Under the auspices of the Outing Club , Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club , which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley , and Bait & Bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a Woodman's Team , which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like . There is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon . City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp . And on the summit of Mount Washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas `` because it is there '' . There is much to be said for such a college -- and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly . Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty '' as something rather specially Hanoverian . Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States . Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university . It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered . The legislators decided to `` liberate '' Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel . For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body . The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history . In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters . A lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea . In an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears , as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax : `` It is , sir , as I have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it . '' Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to Webster's eloquence . This is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group . Eleazar Wheelock , a Presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor . Eleazar , pausing on the Hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences ; ; and also of English Youth and any others '' . It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' . A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 . The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college . The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings . A student orator `` produced tears from a great number of the learned '' even before the punch was served . Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the English language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue . Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached . The cook got drunk , and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself . Future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace . By the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the Big Three , Columbia , and Penn were populous centers of learning , Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine . The dormitories , including the beloved Dartmouth Hall , could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion . Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began . He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college . By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 . And at his last commencement , in that year , Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college . The presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y. , Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there . Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates . But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England . Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class . Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation . About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools . It is still a college only and not a university ; ; it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group . However , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration . All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred . All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study . Students of the college who are candidates for the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year . The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a B.S. in engineering . So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group . It is still , however , the junior member of the League , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do . It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed . However much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition . It has come on with a rush in more significant areas . Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking . But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy . President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an `` aristocracy of brains '' in Hanover . The person who left the buggy there has never been identified . It was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside . There are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma . She didn't like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage . She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed . She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels . If she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her . If police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect . Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect . His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer . Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day . It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse . At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips . A few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders . He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie . It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door . The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse , he would have convicted `` somebody '' . Notice , Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden . He said he would have convicted `` somebody '' . It is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport , a town not far from Fall River . They were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters . Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men . These officers found no incriminating information . Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed . He said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar . The woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner . Fall River is not a fashionable town . The dinner hour there was twelve noon . If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days . It is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time . Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi . They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger . Questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him . The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so Morse's statement really proved nothing . We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock . Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door . Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door . From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away . He met nobody he knew on this walk . There is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed . Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , Mrs. Borden told the servant , `` Bridget , I want you to wash these windows today '' . Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction . She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows . This was long after Morse had left the house . Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there . He knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone . And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true . The screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back . It was unlocked all the time she was washing windows . Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied . Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand . He had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm . Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out . He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar . If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return , he could have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr. Borden came home . With Lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house . With the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood . His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door , was odd . There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them . And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed . The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; ; there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders . On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying . The time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior . He said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house . What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ? He wrote : `` The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge . Neither had any interest in the deaths ; ; indeed , it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive . Both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself '' . That was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect . Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth . He felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl . The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but Lizzie's expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet . This officer had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse , and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them . Fleet asked the same question about Bridget , and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her . Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect . She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner . And , much as she detested Hiram Harrington , she also did not accuse him . At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father . She replied , `` I know of one man that has not been friendly with him . They have not been friendly for years '' . Asked who this was , she named Harrington . Her statement certainly was true ; ; the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview , but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer . When I interviewed Kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard , I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders . He said he had not heard of anybody else . `` How about Bridget Sullivan '' ? ? I inquired . `` Oh , she was just the maid there '' , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was . Kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders . Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders : Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan . All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers . True , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations . The actions of Bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence . There are also other factors that require closer examination . The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut . The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie . If Bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden . Bridget was born in Ireland , one of fourteen children . She was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time . She worked as a domestic , first in Newport for a year , and then in South Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , for another year . She finally settled in Fall River and , after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed , was hired by the Bordens . I have previously described how , during the week of the murder , Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes . Her father , James Upton , was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port . A gentleman of the old school , Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted Christian . The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects . Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests . There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind . She possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty . When she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited . She named 48 items , and said there were `` many more things which it would take too long to write '' . An essay on `` Freedom '' written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence , the freedom given to slaves in Canada , and the views of George Washington . Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ; ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied . A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer . He recalled Lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond '' . The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men . The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this . With four younger children at home , Lucy stepped into her mother's role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879 . But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits . When her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman : `` What is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ? Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you . '' And that she proceeded to do . Many years later ( on August 3 , 1915 ) , Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College : `` While I love botany which , after dabbling in for years , I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing . Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study . Mathematics came next '' . Her study of history was persistently pursued . She read Maitland's Dark Ages , `` which I enjoyed very much '' ; ; La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages , 16 chapters of Bryce `` and liked it more and more '' ; ; more chapters of Guizot ; ; Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church . She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone . Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies . She played chess with him by postcard . Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' . Who won is not revealed , but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words . There was another family interest also . Winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him . At different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist . And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College . Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory . For three years he was connected with the U.S. Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ; ; and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University . The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to Colorado , Virginia , and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia . After her father's death , Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington , D.C. . `` Their house '' , writes Albert S. Flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home '' . Lucy was a lively part of the household . Moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor . Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' . There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college . As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' . While in Washington , D.C. , Lucy Upton held positions in the U.S. Census Office , and in the Pension Bureau . They were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study . After the months in Europe , she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life . What was called an `` accidental meeting '' with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman . Here was a cause she believed in . After correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles , she came to Atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary . She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance . Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ; ; of her `` great power of discernment '' ; ; of `` her exquisiteness of dress '' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers '' ; ; her great love of flowers and plants and birds ; ; and her close knowledge of individual students . She drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world ; ; and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well . Many a student was able to remain at Spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help . Under Miss Upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption . After all , she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , Associate Principal or Dean . She had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology . Miss Upton and Miss Packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common . Both had eager and inquiring minds ; ; and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal . Both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding . In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard , it was Miss Upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability '' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end '' . So strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton . Yet they thrived on it . At the Fifteenth Anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons . When Dr. Wallace Buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the Science Building named for him , he wrote Miss Tapley ( April 7 , 1923 ) `` If you had asked me , I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton . Her services to the School for many years were of a very high character , and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her '' . Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles . At the meeting of the Board of Trustees , on March 3 , 1910 , Miss Upton presented the annual report of the President . She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; ; that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired ; ; and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly . She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission . The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration '' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles . With the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ; ; Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ; walks laid ; ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home . Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses . She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results . Two bequests were recorded : one of $200 under the will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles ; ; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton , New York , a friend from the early days . Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was `` the sorest grief '' the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear . The daughters of Spelman , she said , had never known or thought of Spelman without her . The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had Miss Giles . Now the school was indeed bereft . `` Yet Spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come '' . Miss Mary Jane Packard , Sophia's half-sister , became ill in March , 1910 ; ; and when school closed , she was unable to travel to Massachusetts . She remained in Atlanta through June and July ; ; she died on August sixth . Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885 , Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period . But she decided to stay at Spelman . She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping . Soon the office work claimed all her time . She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships . Quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary . Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister '' . She served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping . The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; ; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers . Mary J. Packard , states a Messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her Master . With infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer . In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job . In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other . In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 . The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school . These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work . Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . The `` diversified occupations '' program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers . The `` distributive education '' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields . In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half . He receives remuneration for his work . In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation . Adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth . In general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next . If the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete . When there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well . Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work . Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one . I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered . He may or may not be `` better off '' than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school . But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent . In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found . In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation . High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work . Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools . However , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual . And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership . This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities . Quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president . Rather we see here another vicious circle . The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers . I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized . Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press . How can the vicious circle be broken ? ? This is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention . It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South . Vocational education I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education . First and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation . Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ; ; however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier . Third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time . Fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality . This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears . Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter . Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used . I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls . These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill . They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school . To be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status . Similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school . Of course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill . So , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics . In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained . In spite of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses . Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule . Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school . Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools . In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts . The neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school . Indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs . He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high schools . The suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs . The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community . Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report . The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions . By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system . It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few . One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber '' , and then , by doing good work , find a job . It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation . Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind . One vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city . In the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in . In a far distant part of the United States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work . `` What does he have in mind to do when he graduates '' ? ? `` Oh , he'll be a plumber '' , came the answer . `` But isn't it almost impossible to get into the union '' ? ? I asked . `` He'll have no difficulty '' , I was told . `` He has very good connections '' . In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city . Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest . An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago . Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students . Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) . I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes . They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics . The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils . The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world . In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil . The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds . Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient . American chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia . Soybean flour , grits , flakes , `` milk '' , and curd can be bought in the United States . Peanuts are the world's second most important legume . They are used mainly for their oil . We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed . Blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off . Cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa . In western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed . Rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats . People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia , New Zealand , and Argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high . Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958 . Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry . About 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals . The rest is used for human food and industrial products . More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock . More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States . The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil . The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops . Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position . Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the China wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an Oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a Brazilian tree ) . Oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal . These oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances . The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages . One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds . Seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils . Some are used in paints along with drying oils . Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin . Castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine . This nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics . Almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances . It is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds . Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives . Sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins . Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries . Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world . Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States , Canada , and Australia . In other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch . Starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations . Gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times . Today the yearly import into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds ; ; of psyllium seed , more than 2.6 million . The discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States . Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents . Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream . Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions . Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands . Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper . The seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value . Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat . The kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily . Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein . Chestnuts are starchy . All nut kernels are rich in protein . The world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the English walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually . Coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets . The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit . World production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 . Exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil . Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg ; ; the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins ; ; the marking nut , used for ink and varnish ; ; the aromatic sassafras nut of South America ; ; and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes . A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm . The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed . It is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery . Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists . The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations . Since Biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an Asiatic grass . Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba . Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry . Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year . Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components . Although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments . Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons . Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection . Still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible . The common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group . Each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported . Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica . Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom . White pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit . Sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt , Brazil , and Central America , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds . It is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the Middle East . Sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the Southwest . Beverages are made from seeds the world over . Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree . World production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons . Per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the United States . Cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree . World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa ( 63 percent ) and South America ( 27 percent ) . Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America . Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages . The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain . Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India . Beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage . Beer was brewed by the Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago . Brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley . Distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol . Seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States . The farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year . Cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised . The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products . Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock . Hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed . Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed . More than 11 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 . The value of products from these industries was 15.8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes . Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products . Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry . To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called `` locatin' '' 'em . To keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called `` loose herdin' '' . To hold 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin' '' . Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted . That became their `` home range '' . Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin' grass and water . These became `` strays '' , the term bein' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as `` stray hosses '' , not merely `` strays '' . Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over . You couldn't stop 'em ; ; you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over , and follow . Such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift '' , or `` winter drift '' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range . The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals . The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as `` strays '' ; ; but when a large number were `` bunched up '' or `` banded up '' , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a `` drift '' . Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede . Drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em , and to find shelter for 'emselves . The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a `` die-up '' . Followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides '' , and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons . Cattle were said to be `` potted '' when `` blizzard choked '' , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a `` drift fence '' durin' a storm . Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the `` winter kill '' . When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to `` bow up '' . This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm '' . Cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered '' . Cattle brought into a range from a distance were called `` immigrants '' . Them new to the country were referred to as `` pilgrims '' . This word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot . Hereford cattle were often called `` white faces '' , or `` open-face cattle '' , and the old-time cowman gave the name of `` hothouse stock '' to them newly introduced cattle . Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply . The cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies '' . A `` cattaloe '' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle . `` Dry stock '' denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin' no milk . A `` wet herd '' was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while `` wet stuff '' referred to cows givin' milk . The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a `` milk pitcher '' . Cows givin' no milk were knowed as `` strippers '' . The terminology of the range , in speakin' of `` dry stock '' and `` wet stock '' , was confusin' to the tenderfoot . The most common reference to `` wet stock '' was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners . The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals . `` Mixed herd '' meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a `` straight steer herd '' was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of `` mixed cattle '' , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes . In the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as `` turn-out time '' , or `` put to grass '' . `` Shootin' 'em out '' was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range . When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin' '' . To stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle '' , and the act was called `` ginnin' 'em 'round '' , or `` chousin' 'em '' . After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called `` throwin' over '' . A cow rose from the ground rear end first . By the time her hindquarters were in a standin' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude . It was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin' cow '' was suggested to the cowboy . They were said to be `` on their heads '' when grazin' . `` On the hoof '' was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail . Shippin' cattle by train was called a `` stock run '' . A general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers '' . When a cowboy spoke of `` dustin' '' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes . The cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin' , and a cow `` on the prod '' or `` on the peck '' was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges . The Injun's name for beef was `` wohaw '' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails . The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters . Listenin' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted `` Whoa '' , `` Haw '' , and `` Gee '' , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin' cattle `` wohaws '' . Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw '' . `` Tailin' '' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope . Any animal could when travelin' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute , seizin' its tail , and givin' the latter a pull to one side . This throwed the animal off balance , and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders . Though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail . Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin' '' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day . It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider . When cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was 'round . When the cowboy used the word `` tailin's '' , he meant stragglers . `` Bull tailin' '' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas . From a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin' a cowhand'd take after 'im . Seizin' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin' the bull off balance , and `` bustin' '' 'im with terrific force . Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called `` peggin' '' . Colors of cattle came in for their special names . An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a `` brindle '' or `` brockle '' . A `` lineback '' was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back , while a `` lobo stripe '' was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many Spanish cattle . A `` mealynose '' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes , face , and nose . Such an animal was said to be `` mealynosed '' . `` Sabinas '' was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin' . The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail `` Sonora reds '' , while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico `` yaks '' , because they came from the Yaqui Injun country , or gave 'em the name of `` Mexican buckskins '' . Near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas '' . This word was from the Spanish , meanin' `` polecat '' . `` Yeller bellies '' were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color . An animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker '' . Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler . Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count '' . The countin' of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a `` pasture count '' . The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead . This method of countin' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd . Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as `` cattle paper '' . A `` book count '' was the sellin' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller . This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the `` books won't freeze '' . This became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests . The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin . His saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces , he said , `` Cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won't freeze '' . In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count , and created a sayin' which has survived through the years . `` Range delivery '' meant that the buyer , after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it . When a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense '' , he meant to pay 'im a high compliment . No matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest . 21 swingin' a wide loop the first use of the word `` rustler '' was as a synonym for `` hustler '' , becomin' an established term for any person who was active , pushin' , and bustlin' in any enterprise . Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and `` rustle the hosses '' , it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in . Eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin' '' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler '' . Later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to `` get out and rustle a few mavericks '' . It was John who found the lion tracks . He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail . He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain . This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass . On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly . Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs , and Means and Loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , Ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the Reef and pointed . Kearton focussed his field glasses . `` That's the Colonel '' , he said , `` But I can't see the dogs '' . As they watched , Jones rode straight for the Reef . Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him . The dogs were working a trail -- lion ? ? Hyena ? ? The pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the Reef , and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly . Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party . `` Not yet '' , cautioned Ulyate . Jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the Reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others . There was Sounder , too , also a veteran of the North Rim , and Rastus and the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds , and a collie from a London pound , and Simba , a terrier . A motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty . Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on . `` Light it '' ! ! Ulyate said , and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out . He threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose . `` That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are '' . Two quick shots sounded . Then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying . Then the heavy roar of a lion . Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound . It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away . At the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot . The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called , Ulyate answered from ten feet away . Nice country to meet a lion in face to face . Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what Ulyate saw : Jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her . Ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , `` The dogs have got her bayed . She's just the other side of that bush '' ! ! And when they had drawn back a step he added : `` Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her . Why she doesn't charge him , I don't know . And he hasn't even got a knife on him . He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground . Careful , don't disturb her '' . Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef . She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say : `` How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct '' ? ? Intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge , yet . He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male . ( In the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso . Of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses . ) She snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs . He threw the lasso . It was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock . Even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her . But John nipped her rear end -- one lion's rear end was as good as another to John , Africa , Arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at John , but he ducked back . Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her . She whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and Ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain ; ; while Jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer . From the lioness' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with . But now she sank lower to the rock . Her roar changed to a growl . Her tail no longer lashed . Although she appeared more subdued and defeated , Jones knew she was growing more dangerous . She was rested and could mount a charge . Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet . At this moment , Loveless and Means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks . The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John . `` We've got to get her out of there '' ! ! Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all . Bring me the firecrackers '' . For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment . Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed . `` Ain't she a beauty , though '' ? ? Called out Means as she ran . `` Don't you go a step nearer her than I do '' , Jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you'll have momentum '' ! ! For two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw . But she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away . It was hot . The dogs were tired . The men were tired too . It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again . And the sun was beginning to go down . If dark came they would lose her . `` I'll get a pole '' , Jones said finally , `` and I'll poke a noose over her head '' ! ! At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef . Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason . Loveless , too , objected . `` It won't work , Colonel '' . `` Just the same we'll try it '' . But without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain . John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood . John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning . She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up . She had chosen the spot well . With the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land . `` Careful , now '' , Jones warned . Means tried her first . Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion . They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn't . Means edged closer . She snarled warningly . Means spit and edged on . Again she snarled , and again he edged . The pony was sidewise to her . With a whirling jump , it could get into gear . However nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah . She charged . Means spun and spurred . For thirty yards she gained rapidly . She was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound . Means held steady one jump ahead of her . Then gradually he began to pull away . A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start . Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means . Of course the factor of head start made all the difference . How much head start ? ? No one knew exactly . That was the whole question . Enough , was the answer . The lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn't catch Means , and made for Jones . As she had done with Means , she gained rapidly at first , but then Baldy began to draw away . Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point . When Jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before . This new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance . There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went . So : Means edged around on the north side of her , Jones moved in from the south . Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention . He succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back . From behind her Means shot forward at a run . Kearton began shouting , `` Wait , wait -- the camera's jammed '' ! ! But Means kept on . He raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off . The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies . But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life . The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty . The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives . Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes . They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical Rover Boys '' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so . As long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt . The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community . Progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors . The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side . Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality . As things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation . The ecumenical congregation The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community . The decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members . It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet . It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical . It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots '' . This way of describing the matter is unfortunate . It implies two misconceptions . One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top '' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels '' . The truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world . The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations . However needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world . The basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation . It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much . Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique . The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken . The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love . Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship . How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ! ! What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes . The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ . It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people . As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it , `` Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us '' . This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all . There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building . Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid . The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists . The local and the ecumenical are one . Of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place . Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other . Neither is adequate if it stands alone . Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other . And this is what all too often happens . Divergent perspectives A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War . With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches . When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones . They were bifocals . He often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical '' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church . It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both . As things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other . On the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town . They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling . Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ! ! Likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals . On the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission . As a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families . It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members . The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world . The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs . It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards . It is growing in numbers . Its people are agreeable friends . It has a beautiful edifice . Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain . It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled . It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible . It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation . And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is . But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world ? ? All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind . It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ . It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy . It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life . It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples . It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa . To put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want . It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world . We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world . There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community . He built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn . Desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it . A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` Do you belong to this church , Mr. Rancher '' ? ? `` Why , no , ma'am '' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me '' ! ! The story reflects the way too many people feel . As long as the congregation regards the church as `` our '' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance . There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ , and that it is His purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do . Local embodiment of the whole A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church . It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ . Yet the truth , according to the New Testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place . Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms ; ; and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap . This was a bitterly fought game , carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight , with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd . Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision . At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys , he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was `` dead '' or the base runners were free to score . This was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship . When the visitors , after losing this game , rode along the village streets toward home , the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly , `` You bunch of hay-shakers ! ! G'ahn back home ! ! You hay-shakers '' ! ! Baseball was surely the national game in those days , even though professional baseball may have been merely a business . Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox . Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places , even if they failed to make the major leagues . Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League , or the Pony League , or the Coastal Plains League , or the fast Eastern League , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere . Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over . Babe Ruth , of course , was everyone's hero , and everyone knew him , even though relatively few ever saw him play ball . His face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life . As the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by Babe Ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account . Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up '' on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done . Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth , who was still called Jidge by all his friends , or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him ( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` Kid '' . Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster , and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs . But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in `` color '' -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field . Ruth was a delinquent boy still , but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it . A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' . One who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , Art the Great , or The Great Shires . It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything , but especially at fighting , and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists . He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; ; and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason . ( This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager . ) The sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public . In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was , for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers . There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ; or who ingested strange objects , like live fish ; ; or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath . One young man , exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment , performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game , landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below , and died at once . But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition . The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments , and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too . While fifty years before , Albert Goodwill Spalding , secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League , could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August , in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate . And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season . The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins . Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire . Ruth himself , still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from Fenway Park , followed by pitchers Carl Mays , Leslie `` Joe '' Bush , Waite Hoyt , Herb Pennock , and Sam Jones , catcher Wally Schang , third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio '' of Ruth , Dugan , and Hoyt ) , and shortstop Everett Scott . By 1926 , when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest , only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest , even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ) , Mark Koenig , Lou Gehrig , George Pipgras , and gray-thatched Earl Combs . The deeds of this team , through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed , have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said . But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall . Babe Ruth , as he always did in the Stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and Tommy Thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where Ruth could not reach it . The ball lay there , shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth , red-necked with frustration , charged about the small patch of ground screaming , `` Where's the -- -ing ball '' ? ? But , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me '' , so little Tommy ran all the way home . The ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days , or of any other sporting event for that matter . Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance . Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park . In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring . This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new . While women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a `` dead game sport '' in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one . The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers ; ; for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball , just as every male American in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists . And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball . Radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have `` Ladies' Days '' any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home . Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears . The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school . This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal . Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of `` identity vs. identity diffusion '' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier . Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers . We hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence . Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age , Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises . The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence . Within Erikson's schema , the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her `` identity diffusion '' , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively . The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion . Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives . Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion . Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately . These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters . Some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences . Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future . For many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general . However , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence . And , as shown in Chapter 6 , , some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents . In the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust . The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; ; and role-experimentation vs. negative identity . A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy . However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ; ; inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ; ; and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded . Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends . To be different is to invite shame and doubt ; ; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status . The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty . Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; ; but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self . Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis . The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood . The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design `` it ought to be '' ) . These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities . If she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded . She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g. , whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ; ; whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; ; whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; ; and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study . Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' . This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ; ; and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes . The absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting . The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship . They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ; they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably . These things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty . As their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs . These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done . Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy . The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience . For example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; ; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting . Sex was both . On the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior . The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals . In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data . Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as `` either-or '' , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant . This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents . Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood . It provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion . The positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty . Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values . The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty . A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e. , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways . For example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice . It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment . In another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the `` true believers '' who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs . The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior . For example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly `` what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly '' . They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse . They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating . They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; ; and they censured parents who `` never disciplined and were too permissive '' or who `` never explained how easy it was to get pregnant '' . In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis . For example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the `` good guys '' and the `` bad guys '' , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences . In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides . An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive . Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure . The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions . The suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system . Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity . In a long and angry footnote to his opinion , Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism . `` It is a duty '' , said Hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation . As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity '' . Observing that `` reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples '' , Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures . He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ; ; the duplication of testimony and exhibits ; ; the numerous squabbles over minor matters ; ; the `` objections stated at outrageous length '' ; ; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , `` uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct '' . The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was `` a striking ( though not singular ) example '' , concluded Hough , `` will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony '' . Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit . William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years . Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a `` horrible example '' . Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House . Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects . But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried . In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912 , he remarked that `` loose statements '' about the case showed scant understanding of the facts . The suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases . Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony . In a private communication written in 1911 , Parker had been more to the point . Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded '' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent . The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance '' for or against the patent , said Parker . `` This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur '' . Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony . The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform . Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony . The taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony . `` I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that '' . In the end Hough's acidulous protest , which Parker called the `` now somewhat famous note on this ' Selden ' case '' , did not go unheeded . In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 , 1913 . The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform . Under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character . Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits . One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , `` at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume '' . While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money . There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit . 3 . Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the A.L.A.M. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association . The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion . Nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade . One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation . Its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath . From the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the A.L.A.M. was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem . Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns . The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims . As early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers . This scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 . In this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation . The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology . One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members . Within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement . Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly . Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry . The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool . But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model T and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor . For those affiliated with it , the A.L.A.M. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 . By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions . It was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail . `` Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view '' , commented a trade journal , `` the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation '' . Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications . One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said : `` I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits '' . The prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee : `` The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste '' . By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information . At this point Charles C. Hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce , successor to the Automobile Board of Trade . Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company , an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 . He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's . Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan . The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme . After the demise of the A.L.A.M. , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool . Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents . `` It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned '' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day '' . With the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland , Howard E. Coffin , Windsor T. White , and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution . The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish , counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce . It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough , Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community . He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value . `` My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making '' , he later told a Congressional committee . The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association . Drawn up in 1914 , the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 . It remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925 . A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the `` Pearl of the Aventine '' . Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta . On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments . The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome . If you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees . Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio , a street lined with stately homes . Oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section . Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino . Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city . The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon These two walks take you through the heart of Rome . You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi . You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens . By seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome . You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City . Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill . The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C. . Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days . Andrea Palladio , an Italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns . Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre . The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you . Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo . Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli , then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei . Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome , the Fontana delle Tartarughe or `` Fountain of the Tortoises '' . It's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square . Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin . The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement . Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei , one of Rome's oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association . Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace . In the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall . The Palazzo Caetani , still inhabited by the Caetani family , adjoins the Palazzo Mattei . Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami , cross the wide Via Arenula , and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli , where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling . Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so . Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini . Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State . Paintings by Titian , Caravaggio , and Rubens are on display ( open 9:30 to 4:00 ) . Before you enter the palazzo , note Francesco Borromini's facade . The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts . The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) . ( This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning . ) By tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective . When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away . The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front . The gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive . The courtyard is magnificently decorated . From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all . Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it . Today it is occupied by the French Embassy . Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ) . Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat . Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome . Today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market . Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle . As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated . The dome of the church is , outside of St. Peter's , one of the largest in Rome . Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca . At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 , , walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona , one of the truly glorious sights in Rome . Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk . The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races . For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events . From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages . Giovanni Bernini's `` Fountain of the Rivers '' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Plate . The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone , the work of Bernini's rival , Borromini . In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square . The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome . Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch . Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace . Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo . The church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations . Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; ; in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento . In front of you is the Palazzo Madama , once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate . Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda . You are now facing the Pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome . This circular edifice , constructed by Agrippa in B.C. 27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian . It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century . As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis , you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns . The Pantheon's interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph . Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling . The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome . Standing before the tomb of Raphael , the great genius of the Renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome . As you leave the Pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the Via Del Seminario , a block to Sant' Ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city . ( Along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , La Sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in Rome . ) The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set . This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome . One block along the Via De Burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune . A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna . The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius . You are now at the Corso , though narrow , one of Rome's busiest streets . Horse races took place here in the Middle Ages . If you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria ( open Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday , 10:00 to 1:00 ) . Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives . Otherwise , cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left . You will come to Alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries . Either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome . To the Spanish steps The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best . Rare , indeed , is the Harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality . I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once . The businessmen and racketeers also have a story . And so do the prostitutes . ( And this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to Harlem , that they are nearly all downtown . ) It is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves . He , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed . He has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ? -- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it . There is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people . He moves through Harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ; ; which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes . And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why , too . Any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination . And these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination . The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world . He is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him . Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in . He cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children . He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way . He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction : into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature . He becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased . One day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up . Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened . What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men . Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words . People who have mastered Kant , Hegel , Shakespeare , Marx , Freud , and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable . The idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions . A kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place . I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South . My recital disturbed him and made him indignant ; ; and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` Why don't all the Negroes in the South move North '' ? ? I tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of Negroes move North . They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety . They do not move to Chicago , they move to the South Side ; ; they do not move to New York , they move to Harlem . The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent . White people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence . But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto . The white people fall back bitterly before the black horde ; ; the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; ; and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf '' . This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as I write , being fought out all up and down those streets . Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury . They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South , without taking any responsibility for it ; ; and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse . Well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is `` worse '' . I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because `` At least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games '' ! ! The guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river . I know another Negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` The spirit of the South is the spirit of America '' . He was born in the North and did his military training in the South . He did not , as far as I can gather , find the South `` worse '' ; ; he found it , if anything , all too familiar . In the second place , though , even if Birmingham is worse , no doubt Johannesburg , South Africa , beats it by several miles , and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world . The world has never lacked for horrifying examples ; ; but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes . This perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling . The emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes . Thirdly , the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us . As far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him . Historically , the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War . Personally , it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past . Everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need . The resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria . None of this is true for the Northerner . Negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality . He never sees Negroes . Southerners see them all the time . Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else . Negroes are , therefore , ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South , and suffer hideously in both places . Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man . It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes , comparatively , bought Cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) . They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change -- cannot change -- until the North changes . The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom . In the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us . It is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own : in the face of one's victim , one sees oneself . Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become . 4 . East River , downtown : postscript to a letter from Harlem the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans . Stevenson's speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in Katanga , the day before , of Patrice Lumumba . Stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the United States was `` against '' colonialism . God knows what the African nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking . I had intended to be there myself . It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death . I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem , for Lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there . I was curious to know if Lumumba's death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our '' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric . And I was curious about the African reaction . However , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery . Had I been there , I , too , in the eyes of most Americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists . The climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the `` cold '' war , have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were `` Communist '' inspired . Nor was it long , naturally , before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community . According , then , to what I take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs . I find this view amazing . It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict . One has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions . The first question is : Would I like to live here ? ? And the second question is : Why don't those who now live here move out ? ? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious . Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are , somehow , different from white people , I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability . Now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives . Wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found . Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity . What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest . It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated . Color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties . Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties . Each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen . As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further . Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square . Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes . The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats . An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots . The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; ; the headsman swung his axe ; ; the head dropped off ; ; end of film . An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage . In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows . In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day . Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story . Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature . Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures . The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter . Of the two , Porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands . Narrative time and film time Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film . One of these is the `` dissolve '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . As the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear . For a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger . In a series of fairy tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions . Immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . Physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing . Linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement . The `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions . So is the time of the novel . The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know . The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely . The film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or `` frames '' , 35-mm.-wide . Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second . This is the rate of projection ; ; it is also the rate of photographing . Time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time . Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence . The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film . Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time . This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician's tricks produced on film . It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued . The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable . Overnight , for one thing , Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten . The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film . One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 . The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies . The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; ; much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's . A band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes . A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out . The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse . As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience . All this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before . Each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . If the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen . In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device . He did more than that . He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . Cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film . The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with . The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . If , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event . If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; ; you are cutting . This is what Porter did . As the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor . She dashes around in alarm . The two events are taking place at the same time . Time and space have both become cinematic . We leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in `` reality '' are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . The `` chase '' as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device . The chase in itself is a narrative ; ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . The cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; ; these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative . The creator of the art of the film : D.W. Griffith There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . The man was D.W. Griffith . When he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes . In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker . Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film . Not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that . But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself . Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented . Great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera . In all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author . The phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera . Not surprisingly , this approach did not work . The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names . But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies . In general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; ; congregational membership , however , is another thing . A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ; that is , when it can preserve economic integration . Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition . The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches . Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ; ( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition . The central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents . Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities . With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city . The key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; ; they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration . The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship . If it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do . They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers . The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit '' of Protestant religious life ; ; in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic parish . We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection . The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members . Mission as co-optation The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations . There is much talk in theological circles about the `` Church as Mission '' and the `` Church's Mission '' ; ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . A crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism . If economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration . The task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . ( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization . ) In a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated . Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ; one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation . In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' . If we add to these contacts with friendly members the `` contacts with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact . On the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; ; the new people respond in kind by joining the church . Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations . This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation . Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going . The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members . The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) . Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members . In general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ; the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership . Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation . The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance . The expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development . It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions . The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ; the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis . It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings . The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations . This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . More than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples . Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests . Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities . Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century . The identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches . It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes . It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities . Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes . The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem . These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations . `` Fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron cage of denominational religion . Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation . What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church . An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity . The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need . With capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue . The directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company . These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers . The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships . The company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show . In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians . The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men . Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them . Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company . In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony . They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts . They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts . In each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses . For southeastern Louisiana , Mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by British traders . Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River . Fort Toulouse , on the Alabama River , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present Nashville , Tennessee , and this was soon abandoned . West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district , of which New Orleans was headquarters . Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain . On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas . It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the Arkansas River . On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers '' . Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada . On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri , `` where there are mines in abundance '' . Each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at New Orleans . An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way . Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors . Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended . The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires . Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans . New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi , and west of that river , and on the Ohio and Wabash . Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district . The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined . Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane , and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body . The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise `` suitable for the peltry trade '' . It decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians . During the first administration of Bienville , the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue . The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins , and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts . These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods . During his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country . The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the Indian needs . The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply . De La Laude , commander of the Alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors . Diron D'Artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors . He became , after a time , commander of a post on the Alabama River , but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade . The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district . Their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees . In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them , and did not make peace for four years . Venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from Mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets . British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French , and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe . The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana . To hold them was an essential part of French policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile . They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf . Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods , French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices . His urgings brought some results . The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins . But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country . The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians , in order to drive back the Carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 . For two years his friend and cousin , Boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance . Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the Carolina advance continued . The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina , and when Perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district . But the Company of the Indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices . To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy . Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians . These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods , and the prices charged the Indians . They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina . They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering . Perier's intrigues gained some successes . The savages divided into two factions ; ; one was British and the other , French . So hostile did these factions become that , among the Choctaws , civil war broke out . Perier's efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country . He asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians . In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory . He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts . No help came from the crown , and Perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette . D'Artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters . But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon French trade in the region was at an end . Perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France . The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the Mississippi . With the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted . They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi . The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts . In January , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony . It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade . It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity . The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres . Thenceforth , the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen . Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies . The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families . Others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade . If this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois . This was a slow and difficult course , and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders . These men were without capital or experience . Perier and Salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts . Bienville , who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits . He reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods . He did find some to trust , however , and he employed the King's soldiers to trade . With no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders . In order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule . The King should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders . They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense . They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports . Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman . The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available . First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters . The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget . Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department . Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; ; the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury . A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department . Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write . With all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly . No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger . In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson . After all , the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners . Not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen ; ; they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty . And are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ? ? Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ? ? The chances are excellent that he will . The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife . People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers . State keeps the junketeering list a secret . The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion . Congress is a harsh master . State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary ; ; its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ; ; embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition . But come the next session of Congress , State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats . The congressman who , in Paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury . In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney , of Brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses . Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with Nikita Khrushchev , but with John Rooney . Nothing worked . In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps . Rooney remained untouched . `` The trouble , '' explained Loy Henderson , then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration , `` is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do '' . One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income . News of the project reached the press . Next day , reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar . They didn't . The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate . Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy , the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back , or on the head of the Secretary of State . With its power to investigate , the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with Dean Acheson . John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson , who was then operating the Senate , refused to let it become an Inquisition . During Dulles's first two years in office , while Republicans ran the Senate , the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 . An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod , a former F.B.I. man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance . So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow . The principal mauler , however , was Senator Joseph McCarthy . Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department , Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates . Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way . In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy . In any event , the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it . He elected to `` get along '' . During this dark chapter in State Department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill . Their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent . Their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas . This , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control . In the new style , the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians . For three or four years in the mid-1950's , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon . It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself . An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation . Getting along with foreigners there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington . They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what Congressman Rooney has called `` that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street '' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians . Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired Lothario . Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies . Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner . Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington . Some , like the British and the French , maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the American scene . Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma . Each has its peculiar style . The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters . When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea . Menshikov hit Washington with a TV announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp . To everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov . Where his predecessors had glowered , Menshikov smiled . Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants , Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails . Overnight he became the most available man in Washington . Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike . In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase , it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of . A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov : `` What should we call you '' ? ? And that Menshikov replied : `` Just call me Mike '' . `` Smilin' Mike '' was the sobriquet Washington gave him . His English was usable and he used it fearlessly . Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried : `` Up your bottom '' ! ! For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods , he was the sensation of Washington . At the State Department , hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits . Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas , too , had been able to smile . The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians usually end . Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics , Moscow resumed scowling and `` Smilin' Mike '' dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West . The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs' , and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians . When King Saud visited Washington , the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family . Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds . The State Department was little help on this , or on much else about Saudi Arabia . A reporter who consulted a Middle East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company . `` This is where I get my information from '' , he confided . `` But bring it right back . It's the only copy I've got '' . The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower . When it ended , a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview . The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central question . How many children did the King have ? ? `` Twenty-one '' , replied the sheik . And how many of these were sons ? ? `` Twenty-five '' , the sheik replied . `` Do you mean to tell us '' , a reporter asked , `` that the King has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons '' ? ? The sheik smiled and murmured : `` That is precisely correct '' . The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language . When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo , a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's . The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the Israeli Foreign Minister , Mrs. Golda Meir . Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions . The deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside . I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom . Of course , most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside . A few newer homes have Western flush toilets , but even with running water , they are usually Eastern style . The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well . They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning . The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom . Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian . They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates . In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers . Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about -- beautiful , artistically talented , an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ) , and yet looking like a pampered , gentle Japanese woman . She was a real experience ! ! The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination . Because Don was leaving the next day , I spent the evening with him at Asia Center . The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school . There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much . There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools . With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan , the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength . The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles , but the younger people , who have lost all faith and convictions , are now parents . There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability . As a result , money is spent quickly and freely , with no thought of its value . Gambling is everywhere , especially among students . Parents indulge their children . The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused . I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they ? ? It will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop . In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good . They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like . Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun . Kyoto After a day at Nikko , Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto . My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome . My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen , but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students , however , that this was not my usual style , for their salaries are very small , and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well . They understood and teased me a bit about it . I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto , Nara , and Hiroshima . Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center . It , along with Nara , was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan . Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ) , her son , Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and Mr. Nishima , one of the science teachers . I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned . We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens . We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony . At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated . They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative . After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ) , I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day . We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending . I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school . They apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and I was a little at a loss to know what to say . There seemed to be no excuse ? ? I don't have the answer yet . We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family . His grandfather is a Buddhist priest ; ; and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest . This is a significant fact in Japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice . In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big . Also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc. . He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them . About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum . The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older , less-hurried times . Nara , Osaka , and Hiroshima Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara . We passed his house and school on the way . In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon . A new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too . Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches . Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day , we started out again to see Nara at night . In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima . Again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me . At Osaka , Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night . It is the second largest city in Japan , with about four million people . One spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river . In the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light . My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m. . I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around . But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand . I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to . They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan . There were no words to say this but there was no need . The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming . Hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding . I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience . A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima . Tokyo On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university , the Japanese Women's University . This day was `` Open House for Parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables . Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun . It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning . Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs . I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants . Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns . At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated . Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women , but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community . Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings . As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions . Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo . Here the women learn to keep house as maids ; ; they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests . They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family . They have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll . Although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough . Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately . Occasionally they return for additional training . Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials . Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house . Her education in the United States , not just in a classroom , but also in an American house with an American housekeeper , stands her in good stead . University of Tokyo After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which Masu had planned , Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo . Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see , but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant . The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded . But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case . The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy . Then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one . It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love's sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy . Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation . Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification . Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate . Moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the Quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) . In any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state , in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national TV network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a `` high yellow gal '' smooching with a white man . It is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different . But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force . The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence . An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means . The end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e.g. , against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County , Tennessee , at the present moment . Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies . This , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used . It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i.e. , that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them . It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality , like any other form of resistance . The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) . One of the sit-in leaders has said : `` Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom . Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them '' . The present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice . However , it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward . And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will . It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means . R. B. Gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance . He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him '' ; ; and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope . In another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values '' . A trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent ; ; and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause . This makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified . The question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him . Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ; and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently . A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression . Among Christian groups , the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure . Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing . `` The primary objective of non-violence '' , writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist , `` is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage '' . Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance . These principles we have now set forth . Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ; ; and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action . Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed . That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals . There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent . The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good . In these terms , the `` economic withdrawal '' of the Negroes of Nashville , Tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out . We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above . There may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people . An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions . `` Billions of American dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers '' , this author states , `` are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white '' . Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail . This leads to the conclusion that `` the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue '' . Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of America , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , U.S. Code Title 19 , Section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor . Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , `` must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation '' .
