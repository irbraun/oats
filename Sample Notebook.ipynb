    "### Loading a dataset from TSV or CSV files\n",
    "This package is intended to work with a data table where each row corresponds to a particular gene or protein, and additional information in the form of natural language and free text or ontology term annotations are present as well. Specifically, this package can work with pandas dataframes objects that are formatted to containa the following columns:\n",
    "* **species**: a string indicating the species this gene belongs to\n",
    "* **gene_names**: a bar-delimited list of gene names, acccessions, or identifiers\n",
    "* **description**: a string of any text information related to this gene\n",
    "* **term_ids**: a bar-delimited list of ontology term IDs associated with this gene\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can be read from a TSV or CSV file or any other source, as long as it can be loaded into a pandas dataframe with that format. Once in a dataframe, this data can be added to a `Dataset` object specific to this package, which has useful wrapper functions for filtering the data, subsetting the data, adding additional data, merging based on gene names, and accessing the data. Once data has been loaded into the `Dataset` object, each entry is assigned a particular ID value which is maintained as an internal reference. Additional data can always be loaded using the **add_data** method. If multiple entries that represent the same genes are likely to have been loaded into the dataset when multiple sources are provided, the method `collapse_by_all_gene_names` can be used to merge entries that have atleast one of the same provided gene names. This method should only be used when the strings present in the gene names field are unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `add_data()`: add a pandas dataframe formatted as described above to the dataset\n",
    "* `collapse_by_all_gene_names()`: merge entries in the dataset that reference the same gene\n"

    "Although the dataset object described above can hold ontology term annotations for genes present in the dataset in additional to natural language descriptions, this package also enables creating new ontology term annotations based on searching the natural language descriptions for occurences of words that either match or are similar to labels or synonyms from some provided input ontology. For example, by providing the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO), we can annotate an entry with the description \"mutants are reduced in height\" with the ontology term PATO:0000587 (decreased size). The input ontology can be provided in the OBO file format for this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides the methods `annotate_rabin_karp()`, `annotate_fuzzy_matching()`, and `annotate_noble_coder()` to generate dictionaries mapping IDs from the dataset object to lists of generated annotations. The first two methods look for either exact matches or alignments within a provided threshold in the descriptions, and the third provides as wrapper for the [NOBLE Coder](http://noble-tools.dbmi.pitt.edu/) annotation tool which handles some of the complexity of finding matches in the text with ontology term labels and synonyms. In this section we are generating a dictionary mapping IDs in the dataset to new ontology term annotations, and then looking at what the readable labels are for some of the terms mapped to a particular description."

    "Ontology term annotations can be used to evaluate similarity between different natural language descriptions. This process involves first inheriting additional terms based on the position of each annotated term in the hierarchy of the ontology, and then applying a metric such as Jaccard similarity to the resulting sets of all inherited terms between any two descriptions. Both of these steps can be handled simultaneously using this package, as demonstrated below. However, the methods for checking individual parent-child relationships in the ontology are also provided, as a wrapper around methods from the [pronto](https://pronto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package. The example here illustrates using the ontology object to find additionally inherited (more general) terms for a particular term in PATO. "

Each term present in the input ontologies is treated as as potential annotation that is either present or absent for a particular text gene entry and text description, as provided by a dictionary of annotations as described above. The function for calculating pairwise distances based on overlap between which terms are present or absent accounts for inheriting additional terms based on the structure of the ontology."

    "### Embedding descriptions as numerical vectors using machine learning approaches\n",
    "Word and document embedding describes the process of translating natural language words or combinations of words into numerical vectors which form an abstracted encoding of the text's original semantics. The processes of training neural networks on tasks which result in learning interal representations of the text are described in several papers including [Mikolov et al. (2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) and [Le and Mikolov (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053). For this example we will use a Doc2Vec document embedding model pre-trained on the English Wikipeida corpus which is available [here](https://github.com/jhlau/doc2vec). As long as a trained model is provided, this package can generate distance matrices for a dataset of genes and their corresponding descriptions. In this example we generate an edgelist like the one obtained above using Jaccard distance between ontology term sets, but using cosine distance between numerical vector representations of the descriptions inferred with a trained Doc2Vec model."

    "This package provides other functions for generating pairwise distance matrices between genes and their associated text descriptions, which make use of the [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) and [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) available through [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). These methods handle encoding a set of descriptions as vectors where each element in the vector represents a word, combination of words, or combination of characters from the provided vocabulary depending on the provided parameters. These methods which are defined as the bag-of-words and n-gram approaches are based on counting the occurences of particular tokens or substrings in the provided text. In this example we generate an edgelist like the one obtained above but with a bag-of-words representations of the text descriptions. This method can take any keyword arguments that can be used with the vectorizer functions described above and they will be used the define how the vectors are constructed. For example, here the arguments specify that the elements to be counted are words, and both single words and pairs of words should be represented as elements in the resulting vector embeddings."

This is useful for comparing the correspondance of distances calculated by individual methods, or for passing multiple values to an aggregating function or ensemble model which combines multiple distance values to provide a consensus edge weight. Additional functions for these purposes are also provided in this package as well. The example here combines the edgelists we obtained using ontology term overlap, Doc2Vec embeddings, and the N-grams approach into a single dataframe and removes the self edges."

    "The `Groupings` object is a general class for containing mappings between the genes in a `Dataset` object (referenced by their IDs in the dataset) and any arbitrary type of classification (such a biochemical pathway membership). This package provides methods for loading any arbitrary classification into a groupings object by providing a CSV file mapping gene names to group assignments. An example is provided in the files section. In addition, methods for generating specific groupings methods through accessing other bioinformatic resources like the [Plant Metabolic Network](https://www.plantcyc.org/) (PMN)'s collection of known biochemcial pathway associations in plants. The `Groupings` object provides the following methods for accessing information related to the mappings it contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_id_to_group_ids_dict()`: accepts a gene dictionary from the dataset and returns a mapping from gene IDs to lists of group IDs\n",
    "* `get_group_id_to_ids_dict()`: accepts a gene dictionary from the dataset and returns a mapping from group IDs to lists of gene IDs\n",
    "* `get_long_name()`: accepts a group ID and returns a longer string of that group's name, where applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the information present in a given groupings object can be accessed by using the `to_csv()` or `to_pandas()` methods, or summarized with the `describe()` method. This example loads a `Groupings` object using the Plant Metabolic Network pathways dataset, which requires passing in a dictionary mapping species names to pathway files downloaded from that source. Our edgelist of distances calculated using annotation and NLP methods is then subset to only include genes which are mapped to atleast one biochemical pathway in this dataset. "

Lower percentiles indicate that the pathways are more easily characterized by the semantic descriptions of their corresponding phenotypes, because the distances values between pairs of genes that are both present in that pathway were lower on average as measured using the natural language phenotype descriptions."
