``oats``
========

This is a python package created to provide functions for generating and working with networks constructed from natural language descriptions. Specifically, this package was designed for datasets of text descriptions associated with genes, for the purposes of predicting gene function or membership in pathways and regulatory networks through constructing similarity networks with genes and their associated descriptions as nodes. However, many of the functions provided here can generalize to any problem requiring constructing similarity networks based on natural language datasets.
